<h2><br>
 The Case of The Lamp That Went Out</h2>

<p>INTRODUCTION TO JOE MULLER</p>

<p>Joseph Muller, Secret Service detective of the Imperial
Austrian<br>
 police, is one of the great experts in his profession. In<br>
 personality he differs greatly from other famous detectives.
He<br>
 has neither the impressive authority of Sherlock Holmes, nor
the<br>
 keen brilliancy of Monsieur Lecoq. Muller is a small,
slight,<br>
 plain-looking man, of indefinite age, and of much humbleness
of<br>
 mien. A naturally retiring, modest disposition, and two
external<br>
 causes are the reasons for Muller's humbleness of manner,
which<br>
 is his chief characteristic. One cause is the fact that in
early<br>
 youth a miscarriage of justice gave him several years in
prison,<br>
 an experience which cast a stigma on his name and which made
it<br>
 impossible for him, for many years after, to obtain honest<br>
 employment. But the world is richer, and safer, by Muller's<br>
 early misfortune. For it was this experience which threw him<br>
 back on his own peculiar talents for a livelihood, and drove
him<br>
 into the police force. Had he been able to enter any other<br>
 profession, his genius might have been stunted to a mere
pastime,<br>
 instead of being, as now, utilised for the public good.</p>

<p><br>
 Then, the red tape and bureaucratic etiquette which attaches
to<br>
 every governmental department, puts the secret service men of
the<br>
 Imperial police on a par with the lower ranks of the
subordinates.<br>
 Muller's official rank is scarcely much higher than that of
a<br>
 policeman, although kings and councillors consult him and
the<br>
 Police Department realises to the full what a treasure it has
in<br>
 him. But official red tape, and his early misfortune ...
prevent<br>
 the giving of any higher official standing to even such a
genius.<br>
 Born and bred to such conditions, Muller understands them,
and<br>
 his natural modesty of disposition asks for no outward
honours,<br>
 asks for nothing but an income sufficient for his simple
needs,<br>
 and for aid and opportunity to occupy himself in the way he
most<br>
 enjoys.</p>

<p>Joseph Muller's character is a strange mixture. The<br>
 kindest-hearted man in the world, he is a human bloodhound
when<br>
 once the lure of the trail has caught him. He scarcely eats
or<br>
 sleeps when the chase is on, he does not seem to know human<br>
 weakness nor fatigue, in spite of his frail body. Once put
on<br>
 a case his mind delves and delves until it finds a clue,
then<br>
 something awakes within him, a spirit akin to that which
holds<br>
 the bloodhound nose to trail, and he will accomplish the
apparently<br>
 impossible, he will track down his victim when the entire
machinery<br>
 of a great police department seems helpless to discover
anything.<br>
 The high chiefs and commissioners grant a condescending
permission<br>
 when Muller asks, "May I do this? ... or may I handle this
case<br>
 this way?" both parties knowing all the while that it is a
farce,<br>
 and that the department waits helpless until this humble
little<br>
 man saves its honour by solving some problem before which
its<br>
 intricate machinery has stood dazed and puzzled.</p>

<p>This call of the trail is something that is stronger than
anything<br>
 else in Muller's mentality, and now and then it brings him
into<br>
 conflict with the department, ... or with his own better
nature.<br>
 Sometimes his unerring instinct discovers secrets in high
places,<br>
 secrets which the Police Department is bidden to hush up and
leave<br>
 untouched. Muller is then taken off the case, and left idle
for<br>
 a while if he persists in his opinion as to the true facts.
And<br>
 at other times, Muller's own warm heart gets him into trouble.
He<br>
 will track down his victim, driven by the power in his soul
which<br>
 is stronger than all volition; but when he has this victim in
the<br>
 net, he will sometimes discover him to be a much finer, better
man<br>
 than the other individual, whose wrong at this particular
criminal's<br>
 hand set in motion the machinery of justice. Several times
that<br>
 has happened to Muller, and each time his heart got the better
of<br>
 his professional instincts, of his practical common-sense,
too,<br>
 perhaps, ... at least as far as his own advancement was
concerned,<br>
 and he warned the victim, defeating his own work. This
peculiarity<br>
 of Muller's character caused his undoing at last, his
official<br>
 undoing that is, and compelled his retirement from the force.
But<br>
 his advice is often sought unofficially by the Department, and
to<br>
 those who know, Muller's hand can be seen in the unravelling
of<br>
 many a famous case.</p>

<p>The following stories are but a few of the many interesting
cases<br>
 that have come within the experience of this great
detective.<br>
 But they give a fair portrayal of Muller's peculiar method
of<br>
 working, his looking on himself as merely an humble member of
the<br>
 Department, and the comedy of his acting under "official
orders"<br>
 when the Department is in reality following out his
directions.</p>

<h2>THE CASE OF THE LAMP THAT WENT OUT</h2>

<h3>by Grace Isabel Colbron and Augusta Groner</h3>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>THE DISCOVERY</h3>

<p><br>
 The radiance of a clear September morning lay over Vienna.
The<br>
 air was so pure that the sky shone in brightest azure even
where<br>
 the city's buildings clustered thickest. On the outskirts of
the<br>
 town the rays of the awakening sun danced in crystalline
ether<br>
 and struck answering gleams from the dew on grass and shrub
in<br>
 the myriad gardens of the suburban streets.</p>

<p><br>
 It was still very early. The old-fashioned steeple clock on
the<br>
 church of the Holy Virgin in Hietzing had boomed out six
slow<br>
 strokes but a short time back. Anna, the pretty blonde girl
who<br>
 carried out the milk for the dwellers in several streets of
this<br>
 aristocratic residential suburb, was just coming around the
corner<br>
 of the main street into a quiet lane. This lane could hardly
be<br>
 dignified by the name of street as yet, it was so very quiet.
It<br>
 had been opened and named scarcely a year back and it was
bordered<br>
 mostly by open gardens or fenced-in building lots. There were
four<br>
 houses in this street, two by two opposite each other, and
another,<br>
 an old-fashioned manor house, lying almost hidden in its
great<br>
 garden. But the quiet street could not presume to ownership
of<br>
 this last house, for the front of it opened on a parallel
street,<br>
 which gave it its number. Only the garden had a gate as
outlet<br>
 onto our quiet lane.</p>

<p>Anna stopped in front of this gate and pulled the bell. She
had<br>
 to wait for some little time until the gardener's wife, who
acted<br>
 as janitress, could open the door. But Anna was not
impatient,<br>
 for she knew that it was quite a distance from the
gardener's<br>
 house in the centre of the great stretch of park to the
little<br>
 gate where she waited. In a few moments, however, the door
was<br>
 opened and a pleasant-faced woman exchanged a friendly
greeting<br>
 with the girl and took the cans from her.</p>

<p>Anna hastened onward with her usual energetic step. The four
houses<br>
 in that street were already served and she was now bound for
the<br>
 homes of customers several squares away. Then her step slowed
just<br>
 a bit. She was a quiet, thoughtful girl and the lovely peace
of<br>
 this bright morning sank into her heart and made her rejoice
in<br>
 its beauty. All around her the foliage was turning gently to
its<br>
 autumn glory of colouring and the dewdrops on the rich-hued
leaves<br>
 sparkled with an unusual radiance. A thrush looked down at
her<br>
 from a bough and began its morning song. Anna smiled up at
the<br>
 little bird and began herself to sing a merry tune.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><br>
 But suddenly her voice died away, the colour faded from her
flushed<br>
 cheeks, her eyes opened wide and she stood as if riveted to
the<br>
 ground. With a deep breath as of unconscious terror she let
the<br>
 burden of the milk cans drop gently from her shoulder to the
ground.<br>
 In following the bird's flight her eyes had wandered to the side
of<br>
 the street, to the edge of one of the vacant lots, there where
a<br>
 shallow ditch separated it from the roadway. An elder-tree,
the<br>
 great size of which attested its age, hung its berry-laden
branches<br>
 over the ditch. And in front of this tree the bird had
stopped<br>
 suddenly, then fluttered off with the quick movement of the
wild<br>
 creature surprised by fright. What the bird had seen was the
same<br>
 vision that halted the song on Anna's lips and arrested her
foot.<br>
 It was the body of a man - a young and well-dressed man, who
lay<br>
 there with his face turned toward the street. And his face was
the<br>
 white frozen face of a corpse.</p>

<p>Anna stood still, looking down at him for a few moments,
in<br>
 wide-eyed terror: then she walked on slowly as if trying to
pull<br>
 herself together again. A few steps and then she turned and
broke<br>
 into a run. When she reached the end of the street,
breathless<br>
 from haste and excitement, she found herself in one of the
main<br>
 arteries of traffic of the suburb, but owing to the early
hour<br>
 this street was almost as quiet as the lane she had just
left.<br>
 Finally the frightened girl's eyes caught sight of the figure
of<br>
 a policeman coming around the next corner. She flew to meet
him<br>
 and recognised him as the officer of that beat.</p>

<p>"Why, what is the matter?" he asked. "Why are you so
excited?"</p>

<p>"Down there-in the lane, there's a dead man," answered the
girl,<br>
 gasping for breath.</p>

<p>"A dead man?" repeated the policeman gravely, looking at the
girl.<br>
 "Are you sure he's dead?"</p>

<p>Anna nodded. "His eyes are all glassy and I saw blood on his
back."</p>

<p>"Well, you're evidently very much frightened, and I suppose
you<br>
 don't want to go down there again. I'll look into the matter,
if<br>
 you will go to the police station and make the announcement.
Will<br>
 you do it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"All right, then, that will gain time for us. Good-bye, Miss
Anna."</p>

<p>The man walked quickly down the street, while the girl hurried
off<br>
 in the opposite direction, to the nearest police station, where
she<br>
 told what she had seen.</p>

<p>The policeman reached his goal even earlier. The first glance
told<br>
 him that the man lying there by the wayside was indeed
lifeless.<br>
 And the icy stiffness of the hand which he touched showed him
that<br>
 life must have fled many hours back. Anna had been right about
the<br>
 blood also. The dead man lay on the farther side of the ditch,
half<br>
 down into it. His right arm was bent under his body, his left
arm<br>
 was stretched out, and the stiffened fingers ... they were
slender<br>
 white fingers ... had sought for something to break his fall.
All<br>
 they had found was a tall stem of wild aster with its purple
blossoms,<br>
 which they were holding fast in the death grip. On the dead
man's<br>
 back was a small bullet-wound and around the edges of it his
light<br>
 grey coat was stained with blood. His face was distorted in
pain<br>
 and terror. It was a nice face, or would have been, did it not
show<br>
 all too plainly the marks of dissipation in spite of the fact
that<br>
 the man could not have been much past thirty years old. He was
a<br>
 stranger to the policeman, although the latter had been on
this<br>
 beat for over three years.</p>

<p>When the guardian of the law had convinced himself that there
was<br>
 nothing more to do for the man who lay there, he rose from
his<br>
 stooping position and stepped back. His gaze wandered up and
down<br>
 the quiet lane, which was still absolutely empty of human
life.<br>
 He stood there quietly waiting, watching over the ghastly
discovery.<br>
 In about ten minutes the police commissioner and the
coroner,<br>
 followed by two roundsmen with a litter, joined the solitary
watcher,<br>
 and the latter could return to his post.</p>

<p>The policemen set down their litter and waited for orders,
while<br>
 the coroner and the commissioner bent over the corpse. There
was<br>
 nothing for the physician to do but to declare that the
unfortunate<br>
 man had been dead for many hours. The bullet which struck him
in<br>
 the back had killed him at once. The commissioner examined
the<br>
 ground immediately around the corpse, but could find nothing
that<br>
 pointed to a struggle. There remained only to prove whether
there<br>
 had been a robbery as well as a murder.</p>

<p>"Judging from the man's position the bullet must have come
from<br>
 that direction," said the commissioner, pointing towards the<br>
 cottages down the lane.</p>

<p>"People who are killed by bullets may turn several times
before<br>
 they fall," said a gentle voice behind the police officer.
The<br>
 voice seemed to suit the thin little man who stood there
meekly,<br>
 his hat in his hand.</p>

<p>The commissioner turned quickly. "Ah, are you there
already,<br>
 Muller?" he said, as if greatly pleased, while the physician
broke<br>
 in with the remark:</p>

<p>"That's just what I was about to observe. This man did not
die<br>
 so quickly that he could not have made a voluntary or
involuntary<br>
 movement before life fled. The shot that killed him might
have<br>
 come from any direction."</p>

<p>The commissioner nodded thoughtfully and there was silence for
a<br>
 few moments. Muller - for the little thin man was none other<br>
 than the celebrated Joseph Muller, one of the most brilliant<br>
 detectives in the service of the Austrian police - looked down
at<br>
 the corpse carefully.. He took plenty of time to do it and<br>
 nobody hurried him. For nobody ever hurried Muller; his
well-known<br>
 and almost laughable thoroughness and pedantry were too valuable
in<br>
 their results. It was a tradition in the police that Muller was
to<br>
 have all the time he wanted for everything. It paid in the
end,<br>
 for Muller made few mistakes. Therefore, his superior the
police<br>
 commissioner, and the coroner waited quietly while the little
man<br>
 made his inspection of the corpse.</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Muller finally, with a polite bow to the<br>
 commissioner, before he bent to brush away the dust on his
knees.</p>

<p>"Well?" asked Commissioner Holzer.</p>

<p>Muller smiled an embarrassed smile as he replied:</p>

<p>"Well ... I haven't found out anything yet except that he is
dead,<br>
 and that he has been shot in the back. His pockets may tell
us<br>
 something more."</p>

<p>"Yes, we can examine them at once," said the commissioner.
"I<br>
 have been delaying that for I wanted you here; but I had no
idea<br>
 that you would come so soon. I told them to fetch you if you
were<br>
 awake, but doubted you would be, for I know you have had no
sleep<br>
 for forty-eight hours."</p>

<p>"Oh, I can sleep, at least with one eye, when I'm on the
chase,"<br>
 answered the detective. "So it's really only twenty-four
hours,<br>
 you see." Muller had just returned from tracking down an<br>
 aristocratic swindler whom he had found finally in a little
French<br>
 city and had brought back to a Viennese prison. He had
returned<br>
 well along in the past night and Holzer knew that the tired
man<br>
 would need his rest. Still he had sent for Muller, who lived
near<br>
 the police station, for the girl's report had warned him that
this<br>
 was a serious case. And in serious cases the police did not
like<br>
 to do without Muller's help.</p>

<p>And as usual when his work called him, Muller was as wide
awake as<br>
 if he had had a good night's sleep behind him. The interest of
a<br>
 new case robbed him of every trace of fatigue. It was he alone -
at<br>
 his own request - who raised the body and laid it on its back
before<br>
 he stepped aside to make way for the doctor.</p>

<p>The physician opened the dead man's vest to see whether the
bullet<br>
 had passed completely through the body. But it had not; there
was<br>
 not the slightest trace of blood upon the shirt.</p>

<p>"There's nothing more for me to do here, Muller," said the<br>
 physician, as he bowed to the commissioner and left the
place.</p>

<p>Muller examined the pockets of the dead man.</p>

<p>"It's probably a case of robbery, too," remarked the
commissioner.<br>
 "A man as well-dressed as this one is would be likely to have
a<br>
 watch."</p>

<p>"And a purse," added the detective. "But this man has neither
- or<br>
 at least he has them no longer."</p>

<p>In the various pockets of the dead man's clothes Muller found
the<br>
 following articles: a handkerchief, several tramway tickets,
a<br>
 penknife, a tiny mirror, and comb, and a little book, a
cheap<br>
 novel. He wrapped them all in the handkerchief and put them in
his<br>
 own pocket. The dead man's coat had fallen back from his
body<br>
 during the examination, and as Muller turned the stiffened
limbs<br>
 a little he saw the opening of another pocket high up over
the<br>
 right hip of the trousers. The detective passed his hand over
the<br>
 pocket and heard something rattle. Then he put his hand in
the<br>
 pocket and drew out a thin narrow envelope which he handed to
the<br>
 commissioner. Holzer looked at it carefully. It was made of
very<br>
 thin expensive paper and bore no address. But it was sealed,<br>
 although not very carefully, for the gummed edges were open
in<br>
 spots. It must have been hastily closed and was slightly
crushed<br>
 as if it had been carried in a clenched hand. The
commissioner<br>
 cut open the envelope with his penknife. He gave an
exclamation<br>
 of surprise as he showed Muller the contents. In the
envelope<br>
 there were three hundred-gulden notes.</p>

<p>The commissioner looked at Muller without a word, but the
detective<br>
 understood and shook his head. "No," he said calmly, "it may be
a<br>
 case of robbery just the same. This pocket was not very easy
to<br>
 find, and the money in it was safer than the dead man's watch
and<br>
 purse would be. That is, if he had a watch and purse - and he
very<br>
 probably had a watch," he added more quickly.</p>

<p>For Muller had made a little discovery. On the lower hem of
the<br>
 left side of the dead man's waistcoat he saw a little lump,
and<br>
 feeling of it he discovered that it was a watch key which
had<br>
 slipped down out of the torn pocket between the lining and
the<br>
 material of the vest. A sure proof that the dead man had had
a<br>
 watch, which in all probability had been taken from him by
his<br>
 murderer. There was no loose change or small bills to be
found<br>
 in any of the pockets, so that it was more than likely that
the<br>
 dead man had had his money in a purse. It seemed to be a
case<br>
 of murder for the sake of robbery. At least Muller and the<br>
 commissioner believed it to be one, from what they had
discovered<br>
 thus far.</p>

<p>The police officer gave his men orders to raise the body and
to<br>
 take it to the morgue. An hour later the unknown man lay in
the<br>
 bare room in which the only spot of brightness were the rays
of<br>
 the sun that crept through the high barred windows and touched
his<br>
 cold face and stiffened form as with a pitying caress. But
no,<br>
 there was one other little spot of brightness in the silent
place.<br>
 It was the wild aster which the dead man's hand still held
tightly<br>
 clasped. The little purple flowers were quite fresh yet, and
the<br>
 dewdrops clinging to them greeted the kiss of the sun's rays
with<br>
 an answering smile.</p>

<h2><br>
 CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>THE BROKEN WILLOW TWIG</h3>

<p><br>
 As soon as the corpse had been taken away, the police
commissioner<br>
 returned to the station. But Muller remained there all alone
to<br>
 make a thorough examination of the entire vicinity.</p>

<p>It was not a very attractive spot, this particular part of
the<br>
 street. There must have been a nursery there at one time,
for<br>
 there were still several ordered rows of small trees to be
seen.<br>
 There were traces of flower cultivation as well, for several<br>
 trailing vines and overgrown bushes showed where shrubs had
been<br>
 grown which do not usually grow without man's assistance.<br>
 Immediately back of the old elder tree Muller found several
fine<br>
 examples of rare flowers, or rather he found the shrubs which
his<br>
 experienced eye recognised as having once borne these
unusual<br>
 blossoms. One or two blooms still hung to the bushes and the<br>
 detective, who was a great lover of flowers, picked them and
put<br>
 them in his buttonhole. While he did this, his keen eyes
were<br>
 darting about the place taking in all the details. This
vacant<br>
 lot had evidently been used as an unlicensed dumping ground
for<br>
 some time, for all sorts of odds and ends, old boots, bits
of<br>
 stuff, silk and rags, broken bottles and empty tin cans, lay
about<br>
 between the bushes or half buried in the earth. What had
once<br>
 been an orderly garden was now an untidy receptacle for
waste.<br>
 The pedantically neat detective looked about him in disgust,
then<br>
 suddenly he forgot his displeasure and a gleam shot up in his
eye.<br>
 It was very little, the thing this man had seen, this man who
saw<br>
 so much more than others.</p>

<p><br>
 About ten paces from where he stood a high wooden fence hemmed
in<br>
 the lot. The fence belonged to the neighbouring property, as
the<br>
 lot in which he stood was not protected in any way. To the
back<br>
 it was closed off by a corn field where the tall stalks
rustled<br>
 gently in the faint morning breeze. All this could be seen
by<br>
 anybody and Muller had seen it all at his first glance. But
now<br>
 he had seen something else. Something that excited him
because<br>
 it might possibly have some connection with the newly
discovered<br>
 crime. His keen eyes, in glancing along the wooden fence at
his<br>
 right hand, had caught sight of a little twig which had worked
its<br>
 way through the fence. This twig belonged to a willow tree
which<br>
 grew on the other side, and which spread its grey-green
foliage<br>
 over the fence or through its wide openings. One of the
little<br>
 twigs which had crept in between the planks was broken, and
it<br>
 had been broken very recently, for the leaves were still
fresh<br>
 and the sap was oozing from the crushed stem. Muller walked
over<br>
 to the fence and examined the twig carefully. He soon saw
how<br>
 it came to be broken. The broken part was about the height of
a<br>
 man's knee from the ground. And just at this height there
was<br>
 quite a space between two of the planks of the fence, heavy<br>
 planks which were laid cross-ways and nailed to thick posts.
It<br>
 would have been very easy for anybody to get a foothold in
this<br>
 open space between the planks.</p>

<p>It was very evidently some foot thrust in between the planks
which<br>
 had broken the little willow twig, and its soft rind had left
a<br>
 green mark on the lower plank. "I wonder if that has anything
to<br>
 do with the murder," thought Muller, looking over the fence<br>
 into the lot on the other side.</p>

<p>This neighbouring plot was evidently a neglected garden. It
had<br>
 once worn an aristocratic air, with stone statues and
artistic<br>
 arrangement of flower beds and shrubs. It was still
attractive<br>
 even in its neglected condition. Beyond it, through the
foliage<br>
 of its heavy trees, glass windows caught the sunlight.
Muller<br>
 remembered that there was a handsome old house in this
direction,<br>
 a house with a mansard roof and wide-reaching wings. He did
not<br>
 now know to whom this handsome old house belonged, a house
that<br>
 must have been built in the time of Maria Theresa, ... but he
was<br>
 sure of one thing, and that was that he would soon find out
to<br>
 whom it belonged. At present it was the garden which
interested<br>
 him, and he was anxious to see where it ended. A few
moments'<br>
 further inspection showed him what he wanted to know. The
garden<br>
 extended to the beginning of the park-like grounds which
surrounded<br>
 the old house with the mansard roof. A tall iron railing
separated<br>
 the garden from the park, but this railing did not extend down
as<br>
 far as the quiet lane. Where it ended there was a light,
well-built<br>
 wooden fence. Along the street side of the fence there was a
high<br>
 thick hedge. Muller walked along this hedge until he came to
a<br>
 little gate. Then crossing the street, he saw that the house
whose<br>
 windows glistened in the sunlight was a house which he knew
well<br>
 from its other side, its front facade.</p>

<p>Now he went back to the elder tree and then walked slowly away
from<br>
 this to the spot where he found the broken willow twig. He
examined<br>
 every foot of the ground, but there was nothing to be seen
that<br>
 was of any interest to him-not a footprint, or anything to
prove<br>
 that some one else had passed that way a short time before.
And<br>
 yet it would have been impossible to pass that way without
leaving<br>
 some trace, for the ground was cut up in all directions by
mole<br>
 hills.</p>

<p>Next the detective scrutinised as much of the surroundings as
would<br>
 come into immediate connection with the spot where the corpse
had<br>
 been found. There was nothing to be seen there either, and
Muller<br>
 was obliged to acknowledge that he had discovered nothing
that<br>
 would lead to an understanding of the crime, unless, indeed,
the<br>
 broken willow twig should prove to be a clue. He sprang back<br>
 across the ditch, turned up the edges of his trousers where
they<br>
 had been moistened by the dew and walked slowly along the
dusty<br>
 street. He was no longer alone in the lane. An old man,
accompanied<br>
 by a large dog, came out from one of the new houses and
walked<br>
 towards the detective, he was very evidently going in the
direction<br>
 of the elder-tree, which had already been such a centre of
interest<br>
 that morning. When he met Muller, the old man halted, touched
his<br>
 cap and asked in a confidential tone: "I suppose you've been
to<br>
 see the place already?"</p>

<p>"Which place?" was Muller's reserved answer.</p>

<p>Why, I mean the place where they found the man who was
murdered.<br>
 They found him under that elder-tree. My wife just heard of it
and<br>
 told me. I suppose everybody round here will know it soon."</p>

<p>"Was there a man murdered here?" asked Muller, as if surprised
by<br>
 the news.</p>

<p>"Yes, he was shot last night. Only I don't understand why I
didn't<br>
 hear the shot. I couldn't sleep a wink all night for the pain
in<br>
 my bones."</p>

<p>"You live near here, then?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I live in No.1. Didn't you see me coming out?"</p>

<p>"I didn't notice it. I came across the wet meadows and I
stooped<br>
 to turn up my trousers so that they wouldn't get dusty - it
must<br>
 have been then you came out."</p>

<p>"Why, then you must have been right near the place I was
talking<br>
 about. Do you see that elder tree there? It's the only one
in<br>
 the street, and the girl who brings the milk found the man under
it.<br>
 The police have been here already and have taken him away.
They<br>
 discovered him about six o'clock and now it's just seven."</p>

<p>"And you hadn't any suspicion that this dreadful thing was<br>
 happening so near you?" asked the detective casually.</p>

<p>"I didn't know a thing, sir, not a thing. There couldn't
have<br>
 been a fight or I would have heard it. But I don't know why
I<br>
 didn't hear the shot."</p>

<p>"Why, then you must have been asleep after all, in spite of
your<br>
 pain," said Muller with a smile, as he walked along beside
the<br>
 man back to the place from which he had just come.</p>

<p>The old man shook his head. "No, I tell you I didn't close
an<br>
 eye all night. I went to bed at half-past nine and I smoked
two<br>
 pipes before I put out the light, and then I heard every
hour<br>
 strike all night long and it wasn't until nearly five
o'clock,<br>
 when it was almost dawn, that I dozed off a bit."</p>

<p>"Then it is astonishing that you didn't hear anything!"</p>

<p>"Sure it's astonishing! But it's still more astonishing that
my<br>
 dog Sultan didn't hear anything. Sultan is a famous watchdog,
I'd<br>
 have you know. He'll growl if anybody passes through the
street<br>
 after dark, and I don't see why he didn't notice what was going
on<br>
 over there last night. If a man's attacked, he generally calls
for<br>
 help; it's a queer business all right."</p>

<p>"Well, Sultan, why didn't you make a noise?" asked Muller,
patting<br>
 the dog's broad head. Sultan growled and walked on
indifferently,<br>
 after he had shaken off the strange hand.</p>

<p>"He must have slept more soundly than usual. He went off into
the<br>
 country with me yesterday. We had an errand to do there and on
the<br>
 way back we stopped in for a drink. Sultan takes a drop or
two<br>
 himself occasionally, and that usually makes him sleep. I had
hard<br>
 work to bring him home. We got here just a few minutes
before<br>
 half-past nine and I tell you we were both good and tired."</p>

<p>By this time they had come to the elder-tree and the old
man's<br>
 stream of talk ceased as he stood before the spot where the<br>
 mysterious crime had occurred. He looked down thoughtfully at
the<br>
 grass, now trampled by many feet. "Who could have done it?"
he<br>
 murmured finally, with a sigh that expressed his pity for the
victim.</p>

<p>"Hietzing is known to be one of the safest spots in
Vienna,"<br>
 remarked Muller.</p>

<p>"Indeed it is, sir; indeed it is. As it would well have to be
with<br>
 the royal castles right here in the neighbourhood! Indeed it
would<br>
 have to be safe with the Court coming here all the time."</p>

<p>"Why, yes, you see more police here than anywhere else in the
city."</p>

<p>"Yes, they're always sticking their nose in where they're
not<br>
 necessary," remarked the old man, not realising to whom he
was<br>
 speaking. "They fuss about everything you do or don't do, and
yet<br>
 a man can be shot down right under our very noses here and
the<br>
 police can't help it."</p>

<p>"But, my dear sir, it isn't always possible for the police
to<br>
 prevent a criminal carrying out his evil intention," said
Muller<br>
 good-naturedly.</p>

<p>"Well, why not? if they watch out sharp enough?"</p>

<p>"The police watch out sharper than most people think. But
they<br>
 can't catch a man until he has committed his crime, can
they?"</p>

<p>"No, I suppose not," said the old man, with another glance at
the<br>
 elder-tree. He bowed to Muller and turned and walked away.</p>

<p>Muller followed him slowly, very much pleased with this
meeting, for<br>
 it had given him a new clue. There was no reason to doubt the
old<br>
 man's story. And if this story was true, then the crime had
been<br>
 committed before half-past nine of the evening previous. For
the<br>
 old man - he was evidently the janitor in No.1 - had not heard
the<br>
 shot.</p>

<p>Muller left the scene of the crime and walked towards the
four<br>
 houses. Before he reached them he had to pass the garden
which<br>
 belonged to the house with the mansard roof. Right and left
of<br>
 this garden were vacant lots, as well as on the opposite
side<br>
 of the street. Then came to the right and left the four new
houses<br>
 which stood at the beginning of the quiet lane. Muller passed
them,<br>
 turned up a cross street and then down again, into the
street<br>
 running parallel, to the lane, a quiet aristocratic street
on<br>
 which fronted the house with the mansard roof.</p>

<p>A carriage stood in front of this house, two great trunks
piled<br>
 up on the box beside the driver. A young girl and an old man
in<br>
 livery were placing bags and bundles of rugs inside the
carriage.<br>
 Muller walked slowly toward the carriage. Just as he reached
the<br>
 open gate of the garden he was obliged to halt, to his own
great<br>
 satisfaction. For at this moment a group of people came out
from<br>
 the house, the owners of it evidently, prepared for a journey
and<br>
 surrounded by their servants.</p>

<p>Beside the old man and the young girl, there were two other
women,<br>
 one evidently the housekeeper, the other possibly the cook.
The<br>
 latter was weeping openly and devoutly kissing the hand of
her<br>
 mistress. The housekeeper discovered that a rug was missing
and<br>
 sent the maid back for it, while the old servant helped the
lady<br>
 into the carriage. The door of the carriage was wide open
and<br>
 Muller had a good glimpse of the pale, sweet-faced and<br>
 delicate-looking young women who leaned back in her corner,<br>
 shivering and evidently ill. The servants bustled about,
making<br>
 her comfortable, while her husband superintended the work
with<br>
 anxious tenderness. He was a tall, fine-looking man with
deep-set<br>
 grey eyes and a rich, sympathetic voice. He gave his orders
to<br>
 his servants with calm authority, but he also was evidently<br>
 suffering from the disease of our century - nervousness, for<br>
 Muller saw that the man's hands clenched feverishly and that
his<br>
 lips were trembling under his drooping moustache.</p>

<p>The maid hastened down with the rug and spread it over her<br>
 mistress's knees, as the gentleman exclaimed nervously: "Do<br>
 hurry with that! Do you want us to miss the train?"</p>

<p>The butler closed the door of the carriage, the coachman
gathered<br>
 up the reins and raised his whip. The housekeeper bowed low
and<br>
 murmured a few words in farewell and the other servants
followed<br>
 her example with tears in their eyes. "You'll see us again
in<br>
 six weeks," the lady called out and her husband added: "If
all<br>
 goes well." Then he motioned to the waiting driver and the<br>
 carriage moved off swiftly, turning the corner in a few
moments.</p>

<p>The little group of servants returned to the courtyard behind
the<br>
 high gates. Muller, whom they had not noticed, was about to
resume<br>
 his walk, when he halted again. The courtyard of the house led
back<br>
 through a flagged walk to the park-like garden that surrounded
it<br>
 on the sides and rear. Down this walk came a young woman. She
came<br>
 so quickly that one might almost call it running. She was
evidently<br>
 excited about something. Muller imagined what this something
might<br>
 be, and he remained to hear what she had to say. He was not<br>
 mistaken. The woman, it was Mrs. Schmiedler, the gardener's
wife,<br>
 began her story at once. "Haven't you heard yet?" she said<br>
 breathlessly. "No, you can't have heard it yet or you
wouldn't<br>
 stand there so quietly, Mrs. Bernauer."</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" asked the woman whom Muller took to be
the<br>
 housekeeper.</p>

<p>"They killed a man last night out here! They found his body
just<br>
 now in the lane back of our garden. The janitor from No.1 told
me<br>
 as I was going to the store, so I went right back to look at
the<br>
 place, and I came to tell you, as I didn't think you'd heard it
yet."</p>

<p>Mrs. Bernauer was evidently a woman of strong constitution and
of<br>
 an equable mind. The other three servants broke out into an<br>
 excited hubbub of talk while she remained quite indifferent
and<br>
 calm. "One more poor fellow who had to leave the world before
he<br>
 was ready," she remarked calmly, with just the natural touch
of<br>
 pity in her voice that would come to any warm-hearted human
being<br>
 upon hearing of such an occurrence. She did not seem at all<br>
 excited or alarmed to think that the scene of the crime had
been<br>
 so near.</p>

<p>The other servants were very much more excited and had
already<br>
 rushed off, under the guidance of the gardener's wife, to look
at<br>
 the dreadful spot. Franz, the butler, had quite forgotten to<br>
 close the front gate in his excitement, and the housekeeper
turned<br>
 to do it now.</p>

<br>
"The fools, see them run," she exclaimed half aloud. "As if<br>
there was anything for them to do there."

<p>The gate closed, Mrs. Bernauer turned and walked slowly to
the<br>
 house. Muller walked on also, going first to the police
station<br>
 to report what he had discovered. Then he went to his own
rooms<br>
 and slept until nearly noon. On his return to the police
station<br>
 he found that notices of the occurrence had already been sent
out<br>
 to the papers.</p>

<p><br>
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>THE EVENING PAPER</h3>

<p><br>
 The autopsy proved beyond a doubt that the murdered man had
been<br>
 dead for many hours before the discovery of his body. The
bullet<br>
 which had struck him in the back had pierced the trachea and<br>
 death had occurred within a few minutes. The only marks for<br>
 identification of the body were the initials L. W. on his
underwear.<br>
 The evening paper printed an exact description of the man's<br>
 appearance and his clothing.</p>

<p>It was about ten o'clock next morning when Mrs. Klingmayer, a
widow<br>
 living in a quiet street at the opposite end of the city
from<br>
 Hietzing, returned from her morning marketing. It was only a
few<br>
 little bundles that she brought with her and she set about
preparing<br>
 her simple dinner. Her packages were wrapped in newspapers,
which<br>
 she carefully smoothed out and laid on the dresser.</p>

<p><br>
 Mrs. Klingmayer was the widow of a street-car conductor and
the<br>
 little pension which she received from the company, as well as
the<br>
 money she could earn for herself, did not permit of the
indulgence<br>
 in a daily newspaper. And yet the reading of the papers was
the<br>
 one luxury for which the simple woman longed. Her grocer, who
was<br>
 a friend of years, knew this and would wrap up her purchases
in<br>
 papers of recent date, knowing that she could then enjoy them
in<br>
 her few moments of leisure. To-day this leisure came
unexpectedly<br>
 early, for Mrs. Klingmayer had less work than usual to attend
to.</p>

<p>Her little flat consisted of two rooms and a kitchen with a
large<br>
 closet opening out from it. She lived in the kitchen and
rented<br>
 the front rooms. Her tenants were a middle-aged man,
inspector<br>
 in a factory, who had the larger room; and a younger man who
was<br>
 bookkeeper in an importing house in the city. But this young
man<br>
 had not been at home for forty-eight hours, a fact, however,
which<br>
 did not greatly worry his landlady. The gentleman in
question<br>
 lived a rather dissipated life and it was not the first time
that<br>
 he had remained away from home over night. It is true that it
was<br>
 the first time that he had not been home for two successive
nights.<br>
 But as Mrs. Klingmayer thought, everything has to happen the
first<br>
 time sometime. "It's not likely to be the last time," the
worthy<br>
 woman thought.</p>

<p>At all events she was rather glad of it to-day, for she
suffered<br>
 from rheumatism and it was difficult for her to get about.
The<br>
 young man's absence saved her the work of fixing up his room
that<br>
 morning and allowed her to get to her reading earlier than
usual.<br>
 When she had put the pot of soup on the fire, she sat down by
the<br>
 window, adjusted her big spectacles and began to read. To
her<br>
 great delight she discovered that the paper she held in her
hand<br>
 bore the date of the previous afternoon. In spite of the
good<br>
 intentions of her friend the grocer, it was not always that
she<br>
 could get a paper of so recent date, and she began to read
with<br>
 doubled anticipation of pleasure.</p>

<p>She did not waste time on the leading articles, for she
understood<br>
 little about politics. The serial stories were a great delight
to<br>
 her, or would have been, if she had ever been able to follow
them<br>
 consecutively. But her principal joy were the everyday
happenings<br>
 of varied interest which she found in the news columns. To-day
she<br>
 was so absorbed in the reading of them that the soup pot began
to<br>
 boil over and send out rivulets down onto the stove.
Ordinarily<br>
 this would have shocked Mrs. Klingmayer, for the neatness of
her<br>
 pots and pans was the one great care of her life. But now,
strange<br>
 to relate, she paid no attention to the soup, nor to the smell
and<br>
 the smoke that arose from the stove. She had just come upon
a<br>
 notice in the paper which took her entire attention. She read
it<br>
 through three times, and each time with growing excitement.
This<br>
 is what she read:</p>

<p>MURDER IN HIETZING</p>

<p>This morning at six o'clock the body of a man about 30
years<br>
 old was discovered in a lane in Hietzing. The man must have<br>
 been dead many hours. He had been shot from behind. The dead<br>
 man was tall and thin, with brown eyes, brown hair and
moustache.<br>
 The letters L. W. were embroidered in his underwear. There
was<br>
 nothing else discovered on him that could reveal- his
identity.<br>
 His watch and purse were not in his pockets: presumably they
had<br>
 been taken by the murderer. A strange fact is that in one of<br>
 his pockets - a hidden pocket it is true - there was the sum
of<br>
 300 guldens in bills.</p>

<p><br>
 This was the notice which made Mrs. Klingmayer neglect the soup
pot.</p>

<p><br>
 Finally the old woman stood up very slowly, threw a glance at
the<br>
 stove and opened the window mechanically. Then she lifted the
pots<br>
 from the fire and set them on the outer edge of the range.
And<br>
 then she did something that ordinarily would have shocked
her<br>
 economical soul - she poured water on the fire to put it
out.</p>

<p>When she saw that there was not a spark left in the stove, she
went<br>
 into her own little room and prepared to go out. Her
excitement<br>
 caused her to forget her rheumatism entirely. One more look
around<br>
 her little kitchen, then she locked it up and set out for the
centre<br>
 of the city.</p>

<p>She went to the office of the importing house where her
tenant,<br>
 Leopold Winkler, was employed as bookkeeper. The clerk at the
door<br>
 noticed the woman's excitement and asked her kindly what the
trouble<br>
 was.</p>

<p>"I'd like to speak to Mr. Winkler," she said eagerly.</p>

<p>"Mr. Winkler hasn't come in yet," answered the young man.
"Is<br>
 anything the matter? You look so white! Winkler will
probably<br>
 show up soon, he's never very punctual. But it's after
eleven<br>
 o'clock now and he's never been as late as this before."</p>

<p>"I 'don't believe he'll ever come again," said the old
woman,<br>
 sinking down on a bench beside the 'door.</p>

<p>"Why, what do you mean?" asked the clerk. "Why shouldn't he
come<br>
 again?"</p>

<p>"Is the head of the firm here?" asked Mrs. Klingmayer, wiping
her<br>
 forehead with her handkerchief. The clerk nodded and hurried
away<br>
 to tell his employer about the woman with the white face who
came<br>
 to ask for a man who, as she expressed it, "would never come
there<br>
 again."</p>

<p>"I don't think she's quite right in the head," he volunteered.
The<br>
 head of the firm told him to bring the woman into the inner
office.</p>

<p>"Who are you, my good woman?" he asked kindly, softened by
the<br>
 evident agitation of this poorly though neatly dressed
woman.</p>

<p>"I am Mr. Winkler's landlady," she answered.</p>

<p>"Ah! and he wants you to tell me that he's sick? I'm afraid I
can't<br>
 believe all that this gentleman says. I hope he's not asking
your<br>
 help to lie to me. Are you sure that his illness is anything
else<br>
 but a case of being up late?"</p>

<p>"I don't think that he'll ever be sick again - I didn't come
with<br>
 any message from him, sir; please read this, sir." And she
handed<br>
 him the newspaper, showing him the notice. While the gentleman
was<br>
 reading she added: "Mr. Winkler didn't come home last night
either."</p>

<p>Winkler's employer read the few lines, then laid the paper
aside<br>
 with a very serious face. "When did you see him last?" he asked
of<br>
 the woman.</p>

<p>"Day before yesterday in the morning. He went away about
half-past<br>
 eight as he usually does," she replied. And then she added a<br>
 question of her own: "Was he here day before yesterday?"</p>

<p>The merchant nodded and pressed an electric bell. Then he rose
from<br>
 his seat and pulled up a chair for his visitor. "Sit down
here.<br>
 This thing has frightened you and you are no longer young."
When<br>
 the servant entered, the merchant told him to ask the head
bookkeeper<br>
 to come to the inner office.</p>

<p>When this official appeared, his employer inquired:<br>
 "When did Winkler leave here day before yesterday?"</p>

<p>"At six o'clock, sir, as usual."</p>

<p>"He was here all day without interruption?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, with the exception of the usual luncheon hour."</p>

<p>"Did he have the handling of any money Monday?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mr. Pokorny," said the merchant, handing his
employee<br>
 the evening paper and pointing to the notice which had so
interested<br>
 him.</p>

<p>Pokorny read it, his face, like his employer's, growing more
serious.<br>
 "It looks almost as if it must be Winkler, sir," he said, in a
few<br>
 moments.</p>

<p>"We will soon find that out. I should like to go to the
police<br>
 station myself with this woman; she is Winkler's landlady - but
I<br>
 think it will be better for you to accompany her. They will
ask<br>
 questions about the man which you will be better able to
answer<br>
 than I."</p>

<p>Pokorny bowed and left the room. Mrs. Klingmayer rose and was
about<br>
 to follow, when the merchant asked her to wait a moment and
inquired<br>
 whether Winkler owed her anything. "I am sorry that you should
have<br>
 had this shock and the annoyances and trouble which will come of
it,<br>
 but I don't want you to be out of pocket by it."</p>

<p>"No, he doesn't owe me anything," replied the honest old
woman,<br>
 shaking her head. A few big tears rolled down over her
withered<br>
 cheeks, possibly the only tears that were shed for the dead
man<br>
 under the elder-tree. But even this sympathetic soul could
find<br>
 nothing to say in his praise. She could feel pity for his
dreadful<br>
 death, but she could not assert that the world had lost
anything<br>
 by his going out of it. As if saddened by the impossibility
of<br>
 finding a single good word to say about the dead man, she left
the<br>
 office with drooping head and lagging step.</p>

<p>Pokorny helped her into the cab that was already waiting
before the<br>
 door. The office force had got wind of the fact that
something<br>
 unusual had occurred and were all at the windows to see them
drive<br>
 off. The three clerks who worked in the department to which
Winkler<br>
 belonged gathered together to talk the matter over. They were
none<br>
 of them particularly hit by it, but naturally they were
interested<br>
 in the discovery in Hietzing, and equally naturally, they tried
to<br>
 find a few good words to say about the man whose life had ended
so<br>
 suddenly.</p>

<p>The youngest of them, Fritz Bormann, said some kind words and
was<br>
 about to wax more enthusiastic, when Degenhart, the eldest
clerk,<br>
 cut in with the words: "Oh, don't trouble yourself. Nobody
ever<br>
 liked Winkler here. 'He was not a good man - he was not even
a<br>
 good worker. This is the first time that he has a reasonable
excuse<br>
 for neglecting his duties."</p>

<p>"Oh, come, see here! how can you talk about the poor man that
way<br>
 when he's scarcely cold in death yet," said Fritz
indignantly.</p>

<p>Degenhart laughed harshly.</p>

<p>"Did I ever say anything else about him while he was warm and
alive?<br>
 Death is no reason for changing one's opinion about a man who
was<br>
 good-for-nothing in life. And his death was a stroke of good
luck<br>
 that he scarcely deserved. He died without a moment's pain, with
a<br>
 merry thought in his head, perhaps, while many another better
man<br>
 has to linger in torture for weeks. No, Bormann, the best I
can<br>
 say about Winkler is that his death makes one nonentity the less
on<br>
 earth."</p>

<p>The older man turned to his desk again and the two younger
clerks<br>
 continued the conversation: "Degenhart appears to be a hard
man,"<br>
 said Fritz, "but he's the best and kindest person I know, and
he's<br>
 dead right in what he says. It was simply a case of
conventional<br>
 superstition. I never did like that Winkler."</p>

<p>"No, you're right," said the other. Neither did I and I
don't<br>
 know why, for the matter of that. He seemed just like a
thousand<br>
 others. I never heard of anything particularly wrong that he
did."</p>

<p>"No, no more did I," continued Bormann, "but I never heard
of<br>
 anything good about him either. And don't you think that it's
worse<br>
 for a man to seem to repel people by his very personality,
rather<br>
 than by any particular bad thing that he does?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I don't know how to explain it, but that's just how I
feel<br>
 about it. I had an instinctive feeling that there was
something<br>
 wrong about Winkler, the sort of a creepy, crawly feeling that
a<br>
 snake gives you."</p>

 CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>SPEAK WELL OF THE DEAD</h3>

<p><br>
 Meanwhile Pokomy and Mrs. Klingmayer had reached the police
station<br>
 and were going upstairs to the rooms of the commissioner on
service<br>
 for the day. Like all people of her class, Mrs. Klingmayer
stood<br>
 in great awe and terror of anything connected with the police
or<br>
 the law generally. She crept slowly and tremblingly up the
stairs<br>
 behind the head bookkeeper and was very glad when she was left
alone<br>
 for a few minutes while Pokorny went in to see the
commissioner.<br>
 But as soon as his errand was known, both the bookkeeper and
his<br>
 companion were led into the office of Head Commissioner Dr.
von<br>
 Riedau, who had charge of the Hietzing murder case.</p>

<p><br>
 When Dr. von Riedau heard the reason of their coming, his
interest<br>
 was immediately aroused, and he pulled a chair to his side for
the<br>
 little thin man with whom he had been talking when the two
strangers<br>
 were ushered in.</p>

<p>"Then you believe you could identify the murdered man?" asked
the<br>
 commissioner.</p>

<p>"From the general description and the initials on his linen,
I<br>
 believe it must be Leopold Winkler," answered Pokorny. "Mrs.<br>
 Klingmayer has not seen him since Monday morning, nor has she
had<br>
 any message from him. He left the office Monday afternoon at
6<br>
 o'clock and that was the last time that we saw him. The only
thing<br>
 that makes me doubt his identity is that the paper reports
that<br>
 three hundred gulden were found in his pocket. Winkler never
seemed<br>
 to have money, and I do not understand how he should have been
in<br>
 possession of such a sum."</p>

<p>"The money was found in the dead man's pockets," said the<br>
 commissioner. "And yet it may be Winkler, the man you know.<br>
 Muller, will you order a cab, please?"</p>

<p>I have a cab waiting for me. But it only holds two,"
volunteered<br>
 Pokorny.</p>

<p>"That doesn't matter, I'll sit on the box," answered the
man<br>
 addressed as Muller.</p>

<p>"You are going with us?" asked Pokorny.</p>

<p>"Yes, he will accompany you," replied the commissioner. "This
is<br>
 detective Muller, sir. By a mere chance, he happened to be on
hand<br>
 to take charge of this case and he will remain in charge,
although<br>
 it may be wasting his talents which we need for more
difficult<br>
 problems. If you or any one else have anything to tell us, it
must<br>
 be told only to me or to Muller. And before you leave to look
at<br>
 the body, I would like to know whether the dead man owned a
watch,<br>
 or rather whether he had it with him on the day of the
murder."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; he did have a watch, a gold watch," answered
Mrs.<br>
 Klingmayer.</p>

<p>Riedau looked at the bookkeeper, who nodded and said: "Yes,
sir;<br>
 Winkler had a watch, a gold watch with a double case. It was
a<br>
 large watch, very thick. I happen to have noticed it by
chance<br>
 and also I happen to know that he had not had the watch for
very<br>
 long."</p>

<p>"Can you tell us anything more about the watch?" asked the<br>
 commissioner of the landlady.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; there was engraving on the outside cover, initials,
and<br>
 a crown on the other side."</p>

<p>"What were the initials?"</p>

<p>"I don't know that, sir; at least I'm not sure about it.
There<br>
 were so many twists and curves to them that I couldn't make
them<br>
 out. I think one of them was a W though, sir."</p>

<p>"The other was probably an L then."</p>

<p>"That might be, sir."</p>

<p>"The younger clerks in the office may be able to tell
something more<br>
 about the watch," said Pokorny, "for they were quite interested
in<br>
 it for a while. It was a handsome watch and they were envious
of<br>
 Winkler's possession of it. But he was so tactless in his
boasting<br>
 about it that they paid no further attention to him after the
first<br>
 excitement."</p>

<p>"You say he didn't have the watch long?"</p>

<p>"Since spring I think, sir."</p>

<p>"He brought it home on the 19th of March," interrupted
Mrs.<br>
 Klingmayer. "I remember the day because it was my birthday.
I<br>
 pretended that he had brought it home to me for a present."</p>

<p>"Was he in the habit of making you presents?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, sir; he was very close with his money, sir.</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps he didn't have much money to be generous with.
Now<br>
 tell me about his watch chain. I suppose he had a watch
chain?"</p>

<p>Both the bookkeeper and the landlady nodded and the latter
exclaimed:<br>
 "Oh, yes, sir; I could recognise it in a minute."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"It was broken once and Mr. Winkler mended it himself. I lent
him<br>
 my pliers and he bent the two links together with them. It
didn't<br>
 look very nice after that, but it was strong again. You could
see<br>
 the mark of the pliers easily."</p>

<p>"Why didn't he take the chain to the jeweler's to be fixed?"
asked<br>
 the commissioner.</p>

<p>The woman smiled. "It wouldn't have been worth the money, sir;
the<br>
 chain wasn't real gold."</p>

<p>"But the watch was real, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, sir; that was real gold. I pawned it once for Mr.
Winkler<br>
 and they gave me 24 gulden for it."</p>

<p>"One question more, did he have a purse? And did he have it
with<br>
 him on the day of the murder?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; he had a purse, and he must have taken it with
him<br>
 because he didn't leave it in his room."</p>

<p>"What sort of a purse was it?"</p>

<p>"A brown leather purse, sir."</p>

<p>"Was it a new one?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, sir; it was well worn."</p>

<p>"How big was it? About like mine?" Riedau took out his own<br>
 pocketbook.</p>

<p>"No, sir; it was a little smaller. It had three pockets in
it.<br>
 I mended it for him once, so I know it well. I didn't have
any<br>
 brown thread so I mended it with yellow."</p>

<p>Dr. von Riedau nodded to Muller. The latter had been sitting
at a<br>
 little side-table writing down the questions and answers.
When<br>
 Riedau saw this he did not send for a clerk to do the work,
for<br>
 Muller preferred to attend to such matters himself as much
as<br>
 possible. The facts gained in the examination were impressed
upon<br>
 his mind while he was writing them, and he did not have to
wade<br>
 through pages of manuscript to get at what he needed. Now he
handed<br>
 his superior officer the paper.</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Riedau, "I'll send it out to the other
police<br>
 stations. I will attend to this myself. You go on with these<br>
 people to see. whether they can identify the corpse."</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later the three stood before the body in the
morgue<br>
 and both the bookkeeper and his companion identified the dead
man<br>
 positively as Leopold Winkler.</p>

<p>When the identification was made, a notice was sent out to
all<br>
 Austrian police stations and to all pawnshops with an exact<br>
 description of the stolen watch and purse.</p>

<p>Muller led his companions back to the commissioner's office
and they<br>
 made their report to Dr. von Riedau. Upon being questioned
further,<br>
 Pokorny stated: "I had very little to do with Winkler. We met
only<br>
 when he had a report to make to me or to show me his books, and
we<br>
 never met outside the office. The clerks who worked in the
same<br>
 room with him, may know him better.. I know only that he was a
very<br>
 reserved man and very little liked."</p>

<p>"Then I do not need to detain you any longer, nor to trouble
you<br>
 further in this affair. I thank you for coming to us so
promptly.<br>
 It has been of great assistance."</p>

<p>The bookkeeper left the station, but Mrs. Klingmayer, who was
now<br>
 quite reassured as to the harmlessness of the police, was asked
to<br>
 remain and to tell what she knew of the private life of the
murdered<br>
 man. Her answers to the various questions put to her proved
that<br>
 she knew very little about her tenant. But this much was
learned<br>
 from her: that he was very close with his money at times, but
that<br>
 again at other times he seemed to have all he wanted to spend.
At<br>
 such times he paid all his debts, and when he stayed home for
supper,<br>
 he would send her out for all sorts of expensive delicacies.
These<br>
 extravagant days seemed to have nothing whatever to do with
Winkler's<br>
 business pay day, but came at odd times.</p>

<p>Mrs. Klingmayer remembered two separate times when he had
received<br>
 a postal money order. But she did not know from whom the
letters<br>
 came, nor even whether they were sent from the city or from
some<br>
 other town. Winkler received other letters now and then, but
his<br>
 landlady was not of the prying kind, and she had paid very
little<br>
 attention to them.</p>

<p><br>
 He seemed to have few friends or even acquaintances. She did
not<br>
 know of any love affair, at least of nothing "regular." He
had<br>
 remained away over night two or three times during the year
that<br>
 he had been her tenant. This was about all that Mrs.
Klingmayer<br>
 could say, and she returned to her home in a cab furnished her
by<br>
 the kind commissioner.</p>

<p>About two hours later, a police attendant announced that a
gentleman<br>
 would like to see Dr. von Riedan on business concerning the
murder in<br>
 Hietzing. "Friedrich Bormann" was the name on the card.</p>

<p>"Ask him to step in here," said the commissioner. "And please
ask<br>
 Mr. Muller to join us."</p>

<p>The good-looking young clerk entered the office bashfully and
Muller<br>
 slipped in behind him, seating himself inconspicuously by the
door.<br>
 At a sign from the commissioner the visitor began. "I am an<br>
 employee of Braun &amp; Co. I have the desk next to Leopold
Winkler,<br>
 during the year that he has been with us - the year and a
quarter to<br>
 be exact -"</p>

<p>"Ah, then you know him rather well?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes. At least we were together all day, although I never
met<br>
 him outside the office."</p>

<p>"Then you cannot tell us much about his private life?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, but there was something happened on Monday, and in
talking<br>
 it over with Mr. Braun, he suggested that I should come to you
and<br>
 tell you about it. It wasn't really very important, and it
doesn't<br>
 seem as if it could have anything to do with this murder and
robbery;<br>
 still it may be of some use."</p>

<p>"Everything that would throw light on the dead man's life
could be<br>
 of use," said Dr. von Riedau. "Please tell us what it is you
know."</p>

<p>Fritz Bormann began: "Winkler came to the office as usual on
Monday<br>
 morning and worked steadily at his desk. But I happened to
notice<br>
 that he spoiled several letters and had to rewrite them,
which<br>
 showed me that his thoughts were not on his work, a frequent<br>
 occurrence with him. However, everything went along as usual
until<br>
 11 o'clock. Then Winkler became very uneasy. He looked
constantly<br>
 toward the door, compared his watch with the office clock,
and<br>
 sprang up impatiently as the special letter carrier, who
usually<br>
 comes about 11 with money orders, finally appeared."</p>

<p>"Then he was expecting money you think?"</p>

<p>"It must have been so. For as the letter carrier passed him,
he<br>
 called out: 'Haven't you anything for me?' and as the man shook
his<br>
 head Winkler seemed greatly disappointed and depressed. Before
he<br>
 left to go to lunch, he wrote a hasty letter, which he put in
his<br>
 pocket.</p>

<p>"He came in half an hour later than the rest of us. He had
often<br>
 been reprimanded for his lack of punctuality, but it seemed to
do<br>
 no good. He was almost always late. Monday was no exception,<br>
 although he was later than usual that day."</p>

<p>"And what sort of a mood was he in when he came back?"</p>

<p>"He was irritable and depressed. He seemed to be awaiting a
message<br>
 which did not come. His excitement hindered him from working,
he<br>
 scarcely did anything the entire afternoon. Finally at five
o'clock<br>
 a messenger boy came with a letter for him. I saw that
Winkler<br>
 turned pale as he took the note in his hand. It seemed to be
only<br>
 a few words written hastily on a card, thrust into an
envelope.<br>
 Winkler's teeth were set as he opened the letter. The messenger
had<br>
 already gone away."</p>

<p>"Did you notice his number?" asked Dr. von Riedau.</p>

<p>"No, I scarcely noticed the man at all. I was looking at
Winkler,<br>
 whose behaviour was so peculiar. When he read the card his
face<br>
 brightened. He read it through once more, then he tore both
card<br>
 and envelope into little bits and threw the pieces out of the
open<br>
 window.</p>

<p>"Then he evidently did not want anybody to see the contents of
this<br>
 note," said a voice from the corner of the room.</p>

<p>Fritz Bormann looked around astonished and rather doubtful at
the<br>
 little man who had risen from his chair and now came
forward.<br>
 Without waiting for an answer from the clerk, the other
continued:<br>
 "Did Winkler have money sent him frequently?"</p>

<p>Bormann looked inquiringly at the commissioner, who replied
with a<br>
 smile: "You may answer. Answer anything that Mr. Muller has to
ask<br>
 of you, as he is in charge of this case."</p>

<p>"As far as I can remember, it happened three times," was
Bormann's<br>
 answer.</p>

<p>"How close together?"</p>

<p>"Why - about once in every three or four months, I think."</p>

<p>"That looks almost like a regular income," exclaimed Riedau.
His<br>
 eyes met Muller's, which were lit up in sudden fire. "Well,
what<br>
 are you thinking of?" asked the commissioner.</p>

<p>"A woman," answered Muller; and continued more as if
thinking<br>
 aloud than as if addressing the others: "Winkler was a
good-looking<br>
 man. Might he not have had a rich love somewhere? Might not
the<br>
 money have come from her, the money that was found in his
pocket?"<br>
 Muller's voice trailed off into indistinctness at the last
words,<br>
 and the fire died out of his eyes. Then he laughed aloud.</p>

<p>The commissioner smiled also, a good-natured smile, such as
one<br>
 would give to a child who has been over-eager. "It doesn't
matter<br>
 to us where the money came from. All that matters here is
where<br>
 the bullet came from - the bullet which prevented his enjoying
this<br>
 money. And it is of more interest to us to find out who robbed
him<br>
 of his life and his property, rather than the source from which
this<br>
 property came.</p>

<p>The commissioner's tone was friendly, but Muller's face
flushed red,<br>
 and his, head dropped. Riedau turned to Bormann and continued:
"And<br>
 because it is of no interest to us where his money came from -
for<br>
 it can have nothing whatever to do with his murder and the
subsequent<br>
 robbery - therefore what you noticed of his behaviour cannot be
of<br>
 any importance or bearing in the case in any way. Unless,
indeed,<br>
 you should find out anything more. But we appreciate the<br>
 thoughtfulness of yourself and your employer and your readiness
to<br>
 help us."</p>

<p>Bormann rose to leave, but the commissioner put out a hand to
stop<br>
 him. "A few moments more, please; you may know of something
else<br>
 that will be of assistance to us. We have heard that Winkler<br>
 boasted of his belongings-did he talk about his private affairs
in<br>
 any way?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, I do not think he did."</p>

<p>"You say that he destroyed the note at once, evidently
realising<br>
 that no one must see it - this note may have been a promise for
the<br>
 money which had not yet come. Did he, however, tell any one
later<br>
 that he expected a certain sum? Do you think he would have
been<br>
 likely to tell any one?"</p>

<p>"No, I do not think that he would tell any one. He never
mentioned<br>
 to any of us that he had received money, or even that he
expected<br>
 to receive it. None of us knew what outside resources he might
have,<br>
 or whence they came. If it had not been that the money was paid
him<br>
 by the carrier in the office two or three times - so, that we
could<br>
 see it - we would none of us have known of this income, except
for<br>
 the fact that he was freer in spending after the money came.
He<br>
 would dine at expensive restaurants, and this fact he would
mention<br>
 to us, whereas at other times he would go to the cheap
cafe."</p>

<p>"Do you know anything about the people he was acquainted
with<br>
 outside the office?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. I seldom met him outside of the office. One evening
it<br>
 did happen that I saw him at Ronacher's. He was there with a<br>
 lady - that is, a so-called 'lady '-and it must have been one
of<br>
 the times that he had money, for they were enjoying an
expensive<br>
 supper. At other times, some of the other clerks met him at
various<br>
 resorts, always with the same sort of woman. But not always
with<br>
 the same woman, for they were different in appearance."</p>

<p>"He was never seen anywhere with other men?"</p>

<p>"No, sir; at least not by any of us."</p>

<p>"He was not liked in the office?"</p>

<p>"No." Bormann's answer was sharp.</p>

<p>"For what reason?"</p>

<p>"I don't know; we just didn't like him. We had very little to
do<br>
 with him at first because of this, and soon we noticed that
he<br>
 seemed just as anxious to avoid us as we were to avoid him."</p>

<p>The commissioner rose and Bormann followed his example. "I am
very<br>
 sorry, sir, if I have taken up your time to no purpose," said
the<br>
 latter modestly, as he took up his hat.</p>

<p>"I am not so sure that what you have said may not be of great
value<br>
 to us," said a voice behind them. Muller stood there, looking
at<br>
 Riedau with a glance almost of defiance. His eyes were again
lit<br>
 up with the strange fire that shone in them when he was on the
trail.<br>
 The commissioner shrugged his shoulders, bowed to the
departing<br>
 visitor, and then turned without an answer to some documents on
his<br>
 desk. There was silence in the room for a few moments. Finally
a<br>
 gentle voice came from Muller's corner again: "Dr. von
Riedau?"</p>

<p>The commissioner raised his head and looked around. "Oh, are
you<br>
 still there?" he asked with a drawl.</p>

<p>Muller knew what this drawl meant. It was the manner adopted
by<br>
 the amiable commissioner when he was in a mood which was not
amiable.<br>
 And Muller knew also the cause of the mood. It was his own
last<br>
 remark, the words he addressed to Bormann. Muller himself
recognised<br>
 the fact that this remark was out of place, that it was almost
an<br>
 impertinence, because it was in direct contradiction to a
statement<br>
 made a few moments before by his superior officer. Also he
realised<br>
 that his remark had been quite unnecessary, because it was a
matter<br>
 of indifference to the young man, who was only obeying his
employer's<br>
 orders in reporting what he had seen, whether his report was
of<br>
 value or not. Muller had simply uttered aloud the thought that
came<br>
 into his mind, a habit of his which years of official training
had<br>
 not yet succeeded in breaking. It was annoying to himself
sometimes,<br>
 for these half-formed thoughts were mere instinct - they were
the<br>
 workings of his own genius that made him catch a suspicion of
the<br>
 truth long before his conscious mind could reason it out or<br>
 appreciate its value. But that sort of thing was not popular
in<br>
 official police life.</p>

<p>"Well," asked the commissioner, as Muller did not continue,
"your<br>
 tongue is not usually so slow - as you have proved just a
few<br>
 moments back - what were you going to say now?"</p>

<p>"I was about to ask your pardon for my interruption. It
was<br>
 unnecessary, I should not have said it."</p>

<p>"Well, I realise that you know better yourself," said Riedau,
now<br>
 quite friendly again, "and now what else have you to say? Do
you<br>
 really think that what the young man has just told us is of
any<br>
 value at all for this case?"</p>

<p>"It seems to me as if it might be of value to us."</p>

<p>"Oh, it seems to you, eh? Your imagination is working
overtime<br>
 again, Muller," said the commissioner with a laugh. But the
laugh<br>
 turned to seriousness as he realised how many times Muller's<br>
 imagination had helped the clumsy official mind to its
proudest<br>
 triumphs. The commissioner was an intelligent man, as far as
his<br>
 lights went, and he was a good-hearted man. He rose from his
chair<br>
 and walked over to where the detective stood. "You needn't look
so<br>
 embarrassed, Muller," he said. "There is no cause for you to
feel<br>
 bad about it. And - I am quite willing to admit that my
remark<br>
 just now was unnecessary. You may give your imagination full
rein,<br>
 we can trust to your intelligence and your devotion to duty to
keep<br>
 it from unnecessary flights. So curbed, I know it will be of
as<br>
 much assistance to us this time as it always has been."</p>

<br>
Muller's quiet face lit up, and his eyes shone in a happiness
that<br>
made him appear ten years younger. That was one of the
strange<br>
things about Joseph Muller. This genius in his profession was
in<br>
all other ways a man of such simplicity of heart and bearing,
that<br>
the slightest word of approval from one of the officials for
whom<br>
he worked could make him as happy as praise from the teacher
will<br>
make a schoolboy. The moments when he was in command of any<br>
difficult case, when these same superiors would wait for a word
from<br>
him, when high officials would take his orders or would be
obliged<br>
to acknowledge that without him they were helpless, these
moments<br>
were forgotten as soon as the problem was solved and Muller
became<br>
again the simple subordinate and the obscure member of the
Imperial<br>
police force.

<p>When Muller left the commissioner's room and walked through
the<br>
 outer office, one of the clerks looked after him and whispered
to<br>
 his companion: "Do you think he's found the Hietzing murderer
yet?"<br>
 The other answered: "I don't think so, but he looks as if he
had<br>
 found a clue. He'll find him sooner or later. He always
does."</p>

<p>Muller did not hear these words, although they also would
have<br>
 pleased him. He walked slowly down the stairs murmuring to
himself:<br>
 "I think I was right just the same. We are following a false
trail."</p>

<h2><br>
 CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>BY A THREAD</h3>

<p><br>
 It was on Monday, the 27th of September, that Leopold Winkler
was<br>
 murdered and robbed, and early on Tuesday, the 28th, his body
was<br>
 found. That day the evening papers printed the report of the
murder<br>
 and the description of the dead man, and on Wednesday, the
29th,<br>
 Mrs. Klingmayer read the news and went to see Winkler's
employer.<br>
 By noon of that day the body was identified and a description
of<br>
 the stolen purse and watch telegraphed to police headquarters
in<br>
 various cities. A few hours later, these police stations had
sent<br>
 out notices by messenger to all pawnshops and dealers in<br>
 second-hand clothing, and now the machinery of the law sat
waiting<br>
 for some news of an attempt on the part of the
robber-and-murderer<br>
 to get rid of his plunder.</p>

<p>On this same Wednesday, about the twilight hour, David
Goldstamm,<br>
 dealer in second-hand clothing, stood before the door of his
shop<br>
 in a side street of the old Hungarian city of Pressburg and
watched<br>
 his assistant take down the clothes which were hanging outside
and<br>
 carry them into the store. The old man's eyes glanced
carelessly<br>
 up and down the street and caught sight of a man who turned
the<br>
 corner and came hurrying towards him. This man was a very<br>
 seedy-looking individual. An old faded overcoat hung about
his<br>
 thin figure, and a torn and dusty hat fell over his left eye.
He<br>
 seemed also to be much the worse for liquor and very wobbly on
his<br>
 feet. And yet he seemed anxious to hurry onward in spite of
the<br>
 unevenness of his walk.</p>

<p><br>
 Then he slowed up suddenly, glanced across the street to
Goldstamm's<br>
 store, and crossed over.</p>

<p>"Have you any boots for me?" he asked, sticking out his right
foot<br>
 that the dealer might see whether he had anything the requisite
size.</p>

<p>"I think there's something there," answered the old man in
his<br>
 usual businesslike tone, leading the way into the store.</p>

<p>The stranger followed. Goldstamm lit the one light in the
little<br>
 place and groped about in an untidy heap of shoes of all kinds
and<br>
 sizes until he found several pairs that he thought might fit.
These<br>
 he brought out and put them in front of his customer. But in
spite<br>
 of his bleary eyes, the man caught sight of some patches on
the<br>
 uppers of one pair, and pushed them away from him.</p>

<p>"Give me something better than that. I can pay for it. I
don't<br>
 have to wear patched shoes," he grunted.</p>

<p>Goldstamm didn't like the looks of the man, but he felt that
he<br>
 had better be careful and not make him angry. "Have patience,
sir,<br>
 I'll find you something better," he said gently, tossing the
heap<br>
 about again, but now keeping his face turned towards his
customer.</p>

<p>"I want a coat also and a warm pair of trousers," said the
stranger<br>
 in a rough voice. He bent down to loosen the shabby boot from
his<br>
 right foot, and as he did so something fell out of the pocket
of<br>
 his coat. An unconscious motion of his own raised foot
struck<br>
 this small object and tossed it into the middle of the heap
of<br>
 shoes close by Goldstamm's hand. The old man reached out after
it<br>
 and caught it. It was just an ordinary brown leather
pocketbook,<br>
 of medium size, old and shabby, like a thousand others. But
the<br>
 eyes of the little old man widened as if in terror, his face
turned<br>
 pale and his hands trembled. For he had seen, hanging from
one<br>
 side of this worn brown leather pocketbook, the end of a
yellow<br>
 thread, the loosened end of the thread with which one side of
the<br>
 purse was mended. The thread told David Goldstamm who it was
that<br>
 had come into his shop.</p>

<p>He regained his control with a desperate effort of the will.
It<br>
 took him but a few seconds to do so, and, thanks to his
partial<br>
 intoxication, the customer had not noticed the shopkeeper's
start<br>
 of alarm. But he appeared anxious and impatient to regain<br>
 possession of his purse.</p>

<p>"Haven't you found it yet?" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Goldstamm hastened to give it back. The tramp put the purse in
his<br>
 pocket with a sigh of relief. Goldstamm had regained his calm
and<br>
 his mind was working eagerly. He put several pairs of shoes
before<br>
 his customer, with the remark: "You must try them on. We'll
find<br>
 something to suit you. And meanwhile I will bring in several<br>
 pairs of trousers from those outside. I have some fine coats
to<br>
 show you too."</p>

<p>Goldstamm went out to the door, almost colliding there with
his<br>
 assistant who was coming in with his arm full of garments. The
old<br>
 man motioned to the boy, who retreated until they were both
hidden<br>
 from the view of the man within the store.</p>

<p>"Give me those blue trousers there," said Goldstamm in a loud
voice.<br>
 Then in a whisper he said to the boy: "Run to the police
station.<br>
 The man with the watch and the purse is in there."</p>

<p>The boy understood and set off at once at a fast pace, while
the<br>
 old man returned to his store with a heavy heart. He
wondered<br>
 whether he would be able to keep the murderer there until
the<br>
 police could come. And he also wondered what it might cost
him,<br>
 an old and feeble man, who would be as a weak reed in the hands
of<br>
 the strong tramp in there. But he knew it was his duty to do<br>
 whatever he could to help in the arrest of one who had just
taken<br>
 the life of a fellow creature. The realisation of this gave
the<br>
 old man strength and calmness.</p>

<p>"A nice sort of an eye for size you have," cried the tramp as
the<br>
 old man came up to him. "I suppose you've brought me in a
boy's<br>
 suit? What do you take me for? Any girl could go to a ball in
the<br>
 shoes you brought me to try on here."</p>

<p>"Are they so much too small?" asked the dealer in an innocent
tone.<br>
 "Well, there's plenty more there. And perhaps you had better
be<br>
 trying on this suit behind the curtain here while I'm hunting up
the<br>
 shoes."</p>

<p>This suggestion seemed to please the stranger, as he was
evidently<br>
 in a hurry. He passed in behind the curtain and began to
undress.<br>
 Goldstamm's keen eyes watched him through a crack. There was
not<br>
 much to be seen except that the tramp seemed anxious to keep
his<br>
 overcoat within reach of his hand. He had carefully put the
purse<br>
 in one of its<br>
 pockets.</p>

<p>We'll get the things all together pretty soon," said the
dealer.<br>
 "I've found a pair of boots here, fine boots of good quality,
and<br>
 sure to fit."</p>

<p>"Stop your talk," growled the other, "and come here and help
me<br>
 so that I can get away."</p>

<p>Goldstamm came forward, and though his heart was very heavy
within<br>
 him, he aided this man, this man about whom so many hundreds
were<br>
 now thinking in terror, as calmly as he had aided his other
poor<br>
 but honest customers.</p>

<p>With hands that did not tremble, the dealer busied himself
about<br>
 his customer, listening all the while to sounds in the street
in<br>
 the hope that his tete-e-tete with the murderer would soon be
over.<br>
 But in spite of all his natural anxiety, the old man's sharp
eyes<br>
 took cognizance of various things, one of which was that the
man<br>
 whom he was helping to dress in his new clothes did not have
the<br>
 watch which was described in the police notice. This fact,
however,<br>
 did not make the old man's heart any lighter, for the purse
mended<br>
 with yellow thread was too clearly the one stolen from the
murdered<br>
 man found in the quiet street in Hietzing.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you, you're so slow? I can get
along<br>
 better myself," growled the tramp, pushing the old man away
from<br>
 him. Goldstamm had really begun to tremble now in spite of
his<br>
 control, in the fear that the man would get away from him before
the<br>
 police came.</p>

<p>The tramp was already dressed in the new suit, into a pocket
of<br>
 which he put the old purse.</p>

<p>"There, now the boots and then we're finished," said the
dealer<br>
 with an attempt at a smile. In his heart he prayed that the
pair<br>
 he now held in his hand might not fit, that he might gain a
few<br>
 minutes more. But the shoes did fit. A little pushing and
stamping<br>
 and the man was ready to leave the store. He was evidently in
a<br>
 hurry, for he paid what was asked without any attempt to
bargain.<br>
 Had Goldstamm not known whom he had before him now, he would
have<br>
 been very much astonished at this, and might perhaps have been
sorry<br>
 that he had not named a higher sum. But under the circumstances
he<br>
 understood only too well the man's desire to get away, and
would<br>
 much rather have had some talk as to the payment, anything
that<br>
 would keep his customer a little longer in his store.</p>

<p>"There, now we're ready. I'll pack up your old things for you.
Or<br>
 perhaps we can make a deal for them. I pay the highest prices
in<br>
 the city," said Goldstamm, with an apparent eagerness which he
hoped<br>
 would deceive the customer.</p>

<p>But the man had already turned towards the door, and called
hack<br>
 over his shoulder: "You can keep the old things, I don't want
them."</p>

<p>As he spoke he opened the door of the store and stood face to
face<br>
 with a policeman holding a revolver. He turned, with a curse,
back<br>
 into the room, but the dealer was nowhere to be seen. David<br>
 Goldstamm had done his duty to the public, in spite of his
fear.<br>
 Now, seeing that the police had arrived, he could think of his
duty<br>
 to his family. This duty was plainly to save his own life,
and<br>
 when the tramp turned again to look for him, he had disappeared
out<br>
 of the back door.</p>

<p>"Not a move or I will shoot," cried the policeman, and now
two<br>
 others appeared behind him, and came into the store. But the<br>
 tramp made no attempt to escape. He stood pale and trembling
while<br>
 they put the handcuffs on him, and let them take him away
without<br>
 any resistance. He was put on the evening express for Vienna,
and<br>
 taken to Police Headquarters in that city. He made no protest
nor<br>
 any attempt to escape, but he refused to utter a word on the
entire<br>
 journey.</p>

<h2><br>
 CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>ALMOST CONVICTED</h3>

<p><br>
 The evening was already far gone when Muller entered Riedau's
office.</p>

<p>"You're in time, the man isn't here yet. The train is
evidently<br>
 late," said the commissioner. "We're working this case off<br>
 quickly. We will have the murderer here in half an hour at
the<br>
 latest. He did not have much time to enjoy the stolen property.
He<br>
 was here in Vienna this morning, and was arrested in Pressburg
this<br>
 afternoon. Here is the telegram, read it."</p>

<p>Dr. von Riedau handed Muller the message. The commissioner
was<br>
 evidently pleased and excited. The telegram read as follows:
"Man<br>
 arrested here in possession of described purse containing four
ten<br>
 gulden notes and four guldens in silver. Arrested in store
of<br>
 second-hand clothes dealer Goldstamm. Will arrive this evening
in<br>
 Vienna under guard."</p>

<p>The message was signed by the Chief of the Pressburg
police.</p>

<p>Muller laid the paper on the desk without a word. There was a
watch<br>
 on this desk already; it was a heavy gold watch, unusually
thick,<br>
 with the initials L. W. on the cover. Just as Muller laid down
the<br>
 telegram, a door outside was opened and the commissioner covered
the<br>
 watch hastily. There was a loud knock at his own door and an<br>
 attendant entered to announce that the party from Pressburg
had<br>
 arrived He was followed by one of the Pressburg police force,
who<br>
 brought the official report.</p>

<p><br>
 "Did you have any difficulty with him?" asked the
commissioner.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, sir; it was a very easy job. He made no resistance at
all,<br>
 and he seems to be quite sober now. But he hasn't said a word
since<br>
 we arrested him."</p>

<p>Then followed the detailed report of the arrest, and the
delivery of<br>
 the described pocketbook to the commissioner.</p>

<p>"Is that all?" asked Dr. von Riedau.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Then you may go home now, we will take charge of the
man."</p>

<p>The policeman bowed and left the room. A few moments later
the<br>
 tramp was brought in, guarded by two armed roundsmen. His
guards<br>
 remained at the door, while the prisoner himself walked forward
to<br>
 the middle of the room. Commissioner von Riedau sat at his
desk,<br>
 his clerk beside him ready to take down the evidence. Muller
sat<br>
 near a window with a paper on his lap, looking the least
interested<br>
 of anybody in the proceedings.</p>

<p>For a moment there was complete silence in the room, which
was<br>
 broken in a rather unusual manner. A deep voice, more like a
growl,<br>
 although it had a queer strain of comic good-nature in it, began
the<br>
 proceedings with the remark: "Well now, say, what do you want of
me,<br>
 anyway?"</p>

<p>The commissioner looked at the man in astonishment, then
turned<br>
 aside that the prisoner might not notice his smile. But he
might<br>
 have spared himself the trouble, for Muller, the clerk, and the
two<br>
 policemen at the door were all on a broad grin.</p>

<p>Then the commissioner pulled himself together again, and began
with<br>
 his usual official gravity: "It is I who ask questions here. Is
it<br>
 possible that you do not know this? You look to me as if you
had<br>
 had experience in police courts before." The commissioner gazed
at<br>
 the prisoner with eyes that were not altogether friendly. The
tramp<br>
 seemed to feel this, and his own eyes dropped, while the
good-natured<br>
 impertinence in his bearing disappeared. It was evidently the
last<br>
 remains of his intoxication. He was now quite sober.</p>

<p>"What is your name?" asked the commissioner.</p>

<p>"Johann Knoll."</p>

<p>"Where were you born?"</p>

<p>"Near Brunn."</p>

<p>"Your age?"</p>

<p>"I'm - I'll be forty next Christmas."</p>

<p>"Your religion?"</p>

<p>"Well, you can see I'm no Jew, can't you?"</p>

<p>"You will please answer my questions in a proper manner.
This<br>
 impertinence will not make things easier for you."</p>

<p>"All right, sir," said the tramp humbly. "I am a
Catholic."</p>

<p>"You have been in prison before?" This was scarcely a
question.</p>

<p>"No, sir," said Knoll firmly.</p>

<p>"What is your business?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what to say, sir," answered Knoll, shrugging
his<br>
 shoulders. "I've done a lot of things in my life. I'm a
cattle<br>
 drover and a lumber man, and I -"</p>

<p>"Did you learn any trade?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, I never learned anything."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to tell me that without having learned any trade
you've<br>
 gotten through life thus far honestly?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I've worked hard enough - I've worked good and hard
sometimes."</p>

<p>"The last few days particularly, eh?"</p>

<p>"Why, no, sir, not these last days - I was drover on a
transport of<br>
 pigs; we brought 'em down from Hungary, 200 of 'em, to the
slaughter<br>
 house here."</p>

<p>"When was that?"</p>

<p>"That was - that was Monday."</p>

<p>"This last Monday?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir.</p>

<p>"And then you went to Hietzing?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, that's right."</p>

<p>"Why did you go to Hietzing?"</p>

<p>"Why, see here, sir, if I had gone to Ottakring, then I
suppose you<br>
 would have asked why did I go to Ottakring. I just went to
Hietzing.<br>
 A fellow has to go somewhere. You don't stay in the same spot
all<br>
 the time, do you?"</p>

<p>Again the commissioner turned his head and another smile
went<br>
 through the room. This Hietzing murderer had a sense of
humour.</p>

<p>"Well, then, we'll go to Hietzing again, in our minds at
least,"<br>
 said the commissioner, turning back to Knoll when he had
controlled<br>
 his merriment. "You went there on Monday, then - and the day
was<br>
 coming to an end. What did you do when you reached
Hietzing?"</p>

<p>"I looked about for a place to sleep."</p>

<p>"Where did you look for a place to sleep?"</p>

<p>"Why, in Hietzing."</p>

<p>"That is not definite enough."</p>

<p>"Well, in a garden."</p>

<p>"You were trespassing, you mean?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes, sir. There wasn't anybody that seemed to want to
invite<br>
 me to dinner or to give me a place to sleep. I just had to
look<br>
 out for myself."</p>

<p>"You evidently know how to look out for yourself at the cost
of<br>
 others, a heavy cost." The commissioner's easy tone had changed
to<br>
 sternness. Knoll felt this, and a sharp gleam shot out from
his<br>
 dull little eyes, while the tone of his voice was gruff and<br>
 impertinent again as he asked: "What do you mean by that?"</p>

<p>"You know well enough. You had better not waste any more time,
but<br>
 tell us at once how you came into possession of this purse."</p>

<p>"It's my purse," Knoll answered with calm impertinence. "I got
it<br>
 the way most people get it. I bought it."</p>

<p>"This purse?" the commissioner emphasised both words
distinctly.</p>

<p>"This purse - yes," answered the tramp with a perfect
imitation of<br>
 Riedau's voice. "Why shouldn't I have bought this purse just
like<br>
 any other?"</p>

<p>"Because you stole this purse from the man whom you -
murdered,"<br>
 was the commissioner's reply.</p>

<p>There was another moment of dead silence in the room. The<br>
 commissioner and Muller watched intently for any change of<br>
 expression in the face of the man who had just had such an<br>
 accusation hurled at him. Even the clerk and the two policemen
at<br>
 the door were interested to see what would happen.</p>

<p>Knoll's calm impertinence vanished, a deadly pallor spread
over his<br>
 face, and he seemed frozen to stone. He attempted to speak, but
was<br>
 not able to control his voice. His hands were clenched and
tremors<br>
 shook his gaunt but strong-muscled frame.</p>

<p>"When did I murder anybody?" he gasped finally in a hoarse
croak.<br>
 "You'll have to prove it to me that I am a murderer."</p>

<p>"That is easily proved. Here is one of the proofs," said
Riedan<br>
 coldly, pointing to the purse. "The purse and the watch of
the<br>
 murdered man are fatal witnesses against you."</p>

<p>"The watch? I haven't any watch. Where should I get a
watch?"</p>

<p>"You didn't have one until Monday, possibly; I can believe
that.<br>
 But you were in possession of a watch between the evening of
Monday,<br>
 the 27th, and the morning of Wednesday, the 29th."</p>

<p>Knoll's eyes dropped again and he did not trust himself to
speak.</p>

<p>"Well, you do not deny this statement?"</p>

<p>"No, I can't," said Knoll, still trying to control his
voice.<br>
 "You must have the watch yourself now, or else you wouldn't be
so<br>
 certain about it."</p>

<p>"Ah, you see, I thought you'd had experience with police
courts<br>
 before," said the commissioner amiably. "Of course I have
the<br>
 watch already. The man whom you sold it to this morning knew
by<br>
 three o'clock this afternoon where this watch came from. He
brought<br>
 it here at once and gave us your description. A very exact<br>
 description. The man will be brought here to identify you
to-morrow.<br>
 We must send for him anyway, to return his money to him. He
paid<br>
 you fifty-two gulden for the watch. And how much money was in
the<br>
 purse that you took from the murdered man?"</p>

<p>"Three gulden eighty-five."</p>

<p>"That was a very small sum for which to commit a murder."</p>

<p>Knoll groaned and bit his lips until they bled.</p>

<p>Commissioner von Riedau raised the paper that covered the
watch and<br>
 continued: "You presumably recognised that the chain on which
this<br>
 watch hung was valueless, also that it could easily be
recognised.<br>
 Did you throw it away, or have you it still?"</p>

<p>"I threw it in the river."</p>

<p>"That will not make any difference. We do not need the chain,
we<br>
 have quite enough evidence without it. The purse, for instance:
you<br>
 thought, I suppose, that it was just a purse like a thousand
others,<br>
 but it is not. This purse is absolutely individual and
easily<br>
 recognised, because it is mended in one spot with yellow
thread.<br>
 The thread has become loosened and hangs down in a very
noticeable<br>
 manner. It was this yellow thread on the purse, which he
happened<br>
 to see by chance, that showed the dealer Goldstamm who it was
that<br>
 had entered his store."</p>

<p>Knoll stood quite silent, staring at the floor. Drops of<br>
 perspiration stood out on his forehead, some of them rolling
like<br>
 tears down his cheek.</p>

<p>The commissioner rose from his seat and walked slowly to where
the<br>
 prisoner stood. He laid one hand on the man's shoulder and said
in<br>
 a voice that was quite gentle and kind again: "Johann Knoll, do
not<br>
 waste your time, or ours, in thinking up useless lies. You
are<br>
 almost convicted of this crime now. You have already
acknowledged<br>
 so much, that there is but little more for you to say. If you
make<br>
 an open confession, it will be greatly to your advantage."</p>

<p>Again the room was quiet while the others waited for what
would<br>
 happen. For a moment the tramp stood silent, with the
commissioner's<br>
 right hand resting on his shoulder. Then there was a sudden
movement,<br>
 a struggle and a shout, and the two policemen had overpowered
the<br>
 prisoner and held him firmly. Muller rose quickly and sprang to
his<br>
 chief's side. Riedau had not even changed colour, and he
said<br>
 calmly: "Oh, never mind, Muller; sit down again. The man had<br>
 handcuffs on and he is quite quiet now. I think he has sense
enough<br>
 to see that he is only harming himself by his violence.</p>

<p>The commissioner returned to his desk and Muller went back to
his<br>
 chair by the window. The prisoner was quiet again, although
his<br>
 face wore a dark flush and the veins on throat and forehead
were<br>
 swollen thick. He trembled noticeably and the heavy drops<br>
 besprinkled his brow.</p>

<p>"I - I have something to say, sir," he began, "but first I
want to<br>
 beg your pardon -"</p>

<p>"Oh, never mind that. I am not angry when a man is fighting
for his<br>
 life, even if he doesn't choose quite the right way," answered
the<br>
 commissioner calmly, playing with a lead pencil.</p>

<p>Knoll's expression was defiant now. He laughed harshly and
began<br>
 again: "What I'm tellin' you now is the truth whether you
believe<br>
 it or not. I didn't kill the man. I took the watch and purse<br>
 from him. I thought he was drunk. If he was killed, I didn't<br>
 do it."</p>

<p>"He was killed by a shot."</p>

<p>"A shot? Why, yes, I heard a shot, but I didn't think any
more<br>
 about it, I didn't think there was anythin' doing, I thought
somebody<br>
 was shootin' a cat, or else-"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't bother to invent things. It was a man who was shot
at,<br>
 the man whom you robbed. But go on, go on. I am anxious to
hear<br>
 what you will tell me."</p>

<p>Knoll's hands, clenched to fists and his eyes glowed in hate
and<br>
 defiance. Then he dropped them to the floor again and began
to<br>
 talk slowly in a monotonous tone that sounded as if he were<br>
 repeating a lesson. His manner was rather unfortunate and did
not<br>
 tend to induce belief in the truth of his story. The gist of
what<br>
 he said was as follows:</p>

<p>He had reached Hietzing on Monday evening about 8 o'clock. He
was<br>
 thirsty, as usual, and had about two gulden in his possession,
his<br>
 wages for the last day's work. He turned into a tavern in
Hietzing<br>
 and ate and drank until his money was all gone, and he had not
even<br>
 enough left to pay for a night's lodging. But Knoll was not
worried<br>
 about that. He was accustomed to sleeping out of doors, and as
this<br>
 was a particularly fine evening, there was nothing in the
prospect<br>
 to alarm him. He set about finding a suitable place where he
would<br>
 not be disturbed by the guardians of the law. His search led
him<br>
 by chance into a newly opened street. This suited him
exactly.<br>
 The fences were easy to climb, and there were several little
summer<br>
 houses in sight which made much more agreeable lodgings than
the<br>
 ground under a bush. And above all, the street was so quiet
and<br>
 deserted that he knew it was just the place for him. He had
never<br>
 been in the street before, and did not know its name. He
passed<br>
 the four houses at the end of the street - he was on the
left<br>
 sidewalk - and then he came to two fenced-in building lots.
These<br>
 interested him. He was very agile, raised himself up on the
fences<br>
 easily and took stock of the situation. One of the lots did
not<br>
 appeal to him particularly, but the second one did. It
bordered<br>
 on a large garden, in the middle of which he could see a
little<br>
 house of some kind. It was after sunset but he could see
things<br>
 quite plainly yet for the air was clear and the moon was
just<br>
 rising. He saw also that in the vacant lot adjoining the
garden,<br>
 a lot which appeared to have been a garden itself once, there
was<br>
 a sort of shed. It looked very much damaged but appeared to
offer<br>
 shelter sufficient for a fine night.</p>

<p>The shed stood on a little raise of the ground near the high
iron<br>
 fence that protected the large garden. Knoll decided that
the<br>
 shed would make a good place to spend the night. He climbed
the<br>
 fence easily and walked across the lot. When he was just
settling<br>
 himself for his nap, he heard the clock on a near-by church
strike<br>
 nine. The various drinks he had had for supper put him in a
mood<br>
 that would not allow him to get to sleep at once. The bench
in<br>
 the old shed was decidedly rickety and very uncomfortable, and
as<br>
 he was tossing about to find a good position, a thought came
into<br>
 his mind which he acknowledged was not a commendable one. It<br>
 occurred to him that if he pursued his investigations in the<br>
 neighbourhood a little further, he might be able to pick up<br>
 something that would be of advantage to him on his
wanderings.<br>
 His eyes and his thoughts were directed towards the handsome
house<br>
 which he could see beyond the trees of the old garden.</p>

<p>The moon was now well up in the sky and it shone brightly on
the<br>
 mansard roof of the fine old mansion. The windows of the
long<br>
 wing which stretched out towards the garden glistened in the<br>
 moonbeams, and the light coloured wall of the house made a
bright<br>
 background for the dark mask of trees waving gently in the
night<br>
 breeze. Knoll's little shed was sufficiently raised on its<br>
 hillock for him to have a good view of the garden. There was
no<br>
 door to the shed and he could see the neighbouring property
clearly<br>
 from where he lay on his bench. While he lay there watching,
he<br>
 saw a woman walking through the garden. He could see her
only<br>
 when she passed back of or between the lower shrubs and bushes.
As<br>
 far as he could see, she came from the main building and was
walking<br>
 towards a pretty little house which lay in the centre of the
garden.<br>
 Knoll had imagined this house to be the gardener's dwelling and
as<br>
 it lay quite dark he supposed the inmates were either asleep or
out<br>
 for the evening. It had been this house which he was intending
to<br>
 honour by a visit. But seeing the woman walking towards it,
he<br>
 decided it would not be safe to carry out his plan just yet
awhile.</p>

<br>
A few moments later he was certain that this last decision had
been<br>
a wise one, for he saw a man come from the main building and
walk<br>
along the path the woman had taken. "No, nothing doing
there,"<br>
thought Knoll, and concluded he had better go to sleep. He
could<br>
not remember just how long he may have dozed but it seemed to
him<br>
that during that time he had heard a shot. It did not interest
him<br>
much. He supposed some one was shooting at a thieving cat or
at<br>
some small night animal. He did not even remember whether he
had<br>
been really sound asleep, before he was aroused by the
breaking<br>
down of the bench on which he lay. The noise of it more than
the<br>
shock of the short fall, awoke him and he sprang tip in alarm
and<br>
listened intently to hear whether any one had been attracted by
it.<br>
His first glance was towards the building behind the garden.
There<br>
was no sound nor no light in the garden house but there was a
light<br>
in the main building. While the tramp was wondering what hour
it<br>
might be, the church clock answered him by ten loud strokes.

<p>His head was already aching from the wine and he did not
feel<br>
 comfortable in the drafty old building. He came out from it,
crept<br>
 along to the spot where he had climbed the fence before, and
after<br>
 listening carefully and hearing nothing on either side, he
climbed<br>
 back to the road. The Street lay silent and empty, which was
just<br>
 what he was hoping for. He held carefully to the shadow thrown
by<br>
 the high board fence over which he had climbed until he came to
its<br>
 end. Then he remembered that he hadn't done anything wrong
and<br>
 stepped out boldly into the moonlight. The moon was well up
now<br>
 and the street was almost as light as day. Knoll was attracted
by<br>
 the queer shadows thrown by a big elder tree, waving its
long<br>
 branches in the wind. As he came nearer he saw that part of
the<br>
 shadow was no shadow at all but was the body of a man lying
in<br>
 the street near the bush. "I thought sure he was drunk" was
the<br>
 way Knoll described it. "I've been like that myself often
until<br>
 somebody came along and found me."</p>

<p>When he came to this spot in his story, he halted and drew a
long<br>
 breath. Commissioner von Riedau had begun to make some figures
on<br>
 the paper in front of him, then changed the lines until the
head<br>
 of a pretty woman in a fur hat took shape under his fingers.</p>

<p>"Well, go on," he said, looking with interest at his drawing
and<br>
 improving it with several quick strokes.</p>

<p>Johann Knoll continued:</p>

<p>"Then the devil came over me and I thought I better take this
good<br>
 opportunity - well - I did. The man was lying on his back and
I<br>
 saw a watch chain on his dark vest. I bent over him and took
his<br>
 watch and chain. Then I felt around in his pocket and found
his<br>
 purse. And then - well then I felt sorry for him lying out in
the<br>
 open road like that, and I thought I'd lift him up and put
him<br>
 somewhere where he could sleep it off more convenient. But I
didn't<br>
 see there was a little ditch there and I stumbled over it
and<br>
 dropped him. 'It's a good thing he's so drunk that even this
don't<br>
 wake him up,' I thought, and ran off. Then I thought I heard<br>
 something moving and I was scared stiff, but there was nothing
in<br>
 the street at all. I thought I had better take to the fields
though<br>
 and I crossed through some corn and then out onto another
street.<br>
 Finally I walked into the city, stayed there till this morning,
sold<br>
 the watch, then went to Pressburg."</p>

<p>"So that was the way it was," said the commissioner, pushing
his<br>
 drawing away from him and motioning to the policemen at the
door.<br>
 "You may take this man away now," he added in a voice of
cool<br>
 indifference, without looking at the prisoner.</p>

<p>Knoll's head drooped and he walked out quietly between his
two<br>
 guards. The clock on the office wall struck eleven.</p>

<p>"Dear me! what a lot of time the man wasted," said the
commissioner,<br>
 putting the report of the proceedings, the watch and the purse
in a<br>
 drawer of his desk. "When anybody has been almost convicted of
a<br>
 crime, it's really quite unnecessary to invent such a long
story.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, the room was empty and Muller, as the
last of<br>
 the group, walked slowly down the stairs. He was in such a
brown<br>
 study that he scarcely heard the commissioner's friendly
"goodnight,"<br>
 nor did he notice that he was walking down the quiet street
under a<br>
 star-gilded sky. "Almost convicted - almost. Almost?"
Muller's<br>
 lips murmured while his head was full of a chaotic rush of
thought,<br>
 dim pictures that came and went, something that seemed to be on
the<br>
 point of bringing light into the darkness, then vanishing
again.<br>
 "Almost - but not quite. There is something here I must find
out<br>
 first. What is it? I must know -"</p>

<h2><br>
 CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>THE FACE AT THE GATE</h3>

<p><br>
 The second examination of the prisoner brought nothing new.
Johann<br>
 Knoll refused to speak at all, or else simply repeated what he
had<br>
 said before. This second examination took place early the
next<br>
 morning, but Muller was not present. He was taking a walk in<br>
 Hietzing.</p>

<p>When they took Johann Knoll in the police wagon to the City
Prison,<br>
 Muller was just sauntering slowly through the street where
the<br>
 murder had been committed. And as the door of the cell shut<br>
 clangingly behind the man whose face was distorted in impotent
rage<br>
 and despair, Joseph Muller was standing in deep thought before
the<br>
 broken willow twig, which now hung brown and dry across the
planks<br>
 of the fence. He looked at it for a long time. That is, he
seemed<br>
 to be looking at it, but in reality his eyes were looking out
and<br>
 beyond the willow twig, out into the unknown, where the
unknown<br>
 murderer was still at large. Leopold Winkler's body had
already<br>
 been committed to the earth. How long will it be before his
death<br>
 is avenged? Or perhaps how long may it even be before it is<br>
 discovered from what motive this murder was committed. Was it
a<br>
 murder for robbery, or a murder for personal revenge perhaps?
Were<br>
 the two crimes committed here by one and the same person, or
were<br>
 there two people concerned? And if two, did they work as<br>
 accomplices? Or is it possible that Knoll's story was true?
Did<br>
 he really only rob the body, not realising that it was a dead
man<br>
 and not merely an intoxicated sleeper as he had supposed?
These<br>
 and many more thoughts rushed tumultuously through Muller's
brain<br>
 until he sighed despairingly under the pressure. Then he
smiled<br>
 in amusement at the wish that had crossed his brain, the wish
that<br>
 this case might seem as simple to him as it apparently did to
the<br>
 commissioner. It would certainly have saved him a lot of work
and<br>
 trouble if he could believe the obvious as most people did.
What<br>
 was this devil that rode him and spurred him on to delve into
the<br>
 hidden facts concerning matters that seemed so simple on the<br>
 surface? The devil that spurred him on to understand that
there<br>
 always was some hidden side to every case? Then the sigh and
the<br>
 smile passed, and Muller raised his head in one of the rare
moments<br>
 of pride in his own gifts that this shy unassuming little man
ever<br>
 allowed himself. This was the work that he was intended by<br>
 Providence to do or he wouldn't have been fitted for it, and it
was<br>
 work for the common good, for the public safety. Thinking back
over<br>
 the troubles of his early youth, Muller's heart rejoiced and
he<br>
 was glad in his own genius. Then the moment of unwonted
elation<br>
 passed and he bent his mind again to the problem before him.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><br>
 He sauntered slowly through the quiet street in the direction
of<br>
 the four houses. To reach them he passed the fence that
enclosed<br>
 this end of the Thorne property. Muller had already known,
for<br>
 the last twenty-four hours at least, that the owner of the
fine<br>
 old estate was an artist by the name of Herbert Thorne. His
own<br>
 landlady had informed him of this. He himself was new to the<br>
 neighbourhood, having moved out there recently, and he had
verified<br>
 her statements by the city directory. As he was now passing
the<br>
 Thorne property, in his slow, sauntering walk, he had just
come<br>
 within a dozen paces of the little wooden gate in the fence
when<br>
 this gate opened. Muller's naturally soft tread was made
still<br>
 more noiseless by the fact that he wore wide soft shoes.
Years<br>
 before he had acquired a bad case of chilblains, in fact had
been<br>
 in imminent danger of having his feet frozen by standing for
five<br>
 hours in the snow in front of a house, to intercept several<br>
 aristocratic gentlemen who sooner or later would be obliged
to<br>
 leave that house. The police had long suspected the existence
of<br>
 this high-class gambling den; but it was not until they had
put<br>
 Muller in charge of the case, that there were any results
attained.<br>
 The arrests were made at the risk of permanent injury to the<br>
 celebrated detective. Since then, Muller's step was more
noiseless<br>
 than usual, and now the woman who opened the gate and peered
out<br>
 cautiously did not hear his approach nor did she see him
standing<br>
 in the shadow of the fence. She looked towards the other end
of<br>
 the street, then turned and spoke to somebody behind her.
"There's<br>
 nobody coming from that direction," he said. Then she turned
her<br>
 head the other way and saw Muller. She looked at him for a
moment<br>
 and slammed the gate shut, disappearing behind it. Muller
heard<br>
 the lock click and heard the beat of running feet hastening
rapidly<br>
 over the gravel path through the garden.</p>

<p>The detective stood immediately in front of the gate, shaking
his<br>
 head. "What was the matter with the woman? What was it that
she<br>
 wanted to see or do in the street? Why should she run away
when<br>
 she saw me?" These were his thoughts. But he didn't waste
time<br>
 in merely thinking. Muller never did. Action followed
thought<br>
 with him very quickly. He saw a knot-hole in the fence just<br>
 beside the gate and he applied his eyes to this knot-hole.
And<br>
 through the knot-hole he saw something that interested and<br>
 surprised him.</p>

<p>The woman whose face had appeared so suddenly at the gate,
and<br>
 disappeared still more suddenly, was the same woman whom he
had<br>
 seen bidding farewell to Mr. Thorne and his wife on the
Tuesday<br>
 morning previous, the woman whom he took to be the
housekeeper.<br>
 The old butler stood beside her. It was undoubtedly the same
man,<br>
 although he had worn a livery then and was now dressed in a<br>
 comfortable old house coat. He stood beside the woman,
shaking<br>
 his head and asking her just the questions that Muller was
asking<br>
 himself at the moment.</p>

<p>"Why, what is the matter with you, Mrs. Bernaner? You're
so<br>
 nervous since yesterday. Are you ill? Everything seems to<br>
 frighten you? Why did you run away from that gate so suddenly?
I<br>
 thought you wanted me to show you the place?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Bernauer raised her head and Muller saw that her face
looked<br>
 pale and haggard and that her eyes shone with an uneasy
feverish<br>
 light. She did not answer the old man's questions, but made
a<br>
 gesture of farewell and then turned and walked slowly towards
the<br>
 house. She realised, apparently, and feared, perhaps, that
the<br>
 man who was passing the gate might have, noticed her sudden
change<br>
 of demeanour and that he was listening to what she might say.
She<br>
 did not think of the knot-hole in the board fence, or she
might<br>
 have been more careful in hiding her distraught face from
possible<br>
 observers.</p>

<p>Muller stood watching through this knot-hole for some little
time.<br>
 He took a careful observation of the garden, and from his point
of<br>
 vantage he could easily see the little house which was
apparently<br>
 the dwelling of the gardener, as well as the mansard roof of
the<br>
 main building. There was considerable distance between the
two<br>
 houses. The detective decided that it might interest him to
know<br>
 something more about this garden, this house and the people
who<br>
 lived there. And when Muller made such a decision it was
usually<br>
 not very long before he carried it out.</p>

<p>The other street, upon which the main front of the mansard
house<br>
 opened, contained a few isolated dwellings surrounded by
gardens<br>
 and a number of newly built apartment houses. On the ground
floor<br>
 of these latter houses were a number of stores and
immediately<br>
 opposite the Thorne mansion was a little cafe. This suited
Muller<br>
 exactly, for he had been there before and he remembered that
from<br>
 one of the windows there was an excellent view of the gate and
the<br>
 front entrance of the mansion opposite. It was a very modest
little<br>
 cafe, but there was a fairly good wine to be had there and
the<br>
 detective made it an excuse to sit down by the window, as if<br>
 enjoying his bottle while admiring the changing colours of
the<br>
 foliage in the gardens opposite.</p>

<p>Another rather good chance, he discovered, was the fact that
the<br>
 landlord belonged to the talkative sort, and believed that
the<br>
 refreshments he had to sell were rendered doubly agreeable
when<br>
 spiced by conversation. In this case the good man was not
mistaken.<br>
 It was scarcely ten o'clock in the forenoon and there were
very<br>
 few people in the cafe. The landlord was quite at leisure to<br>
 devote himself to this stranger in the window seat, whom he did
not<br>
 remember to have seen before, and who was therefore doubly<br>
 interesting to him. Several subjects of conversation usual in
such<br>
 cases, such as politics and the weather, seemed to arouse no<br>
 particular enthusiasm in his patron's manner. Finally the
portly<br>
 landlord decided that he would touch upon the theme which was
still<br>
 absorbing all Hietzing.</p>

<p>"Oh, by the way, sir, do you know that you are in the
immediate<br>
 vicinity of the place where the murder of Monday evening was<br>
 committed? People are still talking about it around here. And
I<br>
 see by the papers that the murderer was arrested in
Pressburg<br>
 yesterday and brought to Vienna last night."</p>

<p>"Indeed, is that so? I haven't seen a paper to-day,"
replied<br>
 Muller, awakening from his apparent indifference.</p>

<p>The landlord was flattered by the success of the new subject,
and<br>
 stood ready to unloose the floodgates of his eloquence. His
customer<br>
 sat up and asked the question for which the landlord was
waiting.</p>

<p>"So it was around here that the man was shot?"</p>

<p>"Yes. His name was Leopold Winkler, that was in the papers
to-day<br>
 too. You see that pretty house opposite? Well, right behind
this<br>
 house is the garden that belongs to it and back of that, an
old<br>
 garden which has been neglected for some time. It was at the
end<br>
 of this garden where it touches the other street, that they
found<br>
 the man under a big elder-tree, early Tuesday morning, day
before<br>
 yesterday."</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed!" said. Muller, greatly interested, as if this
was<br>
 the first he had heard of it. The landlord took a deep breath
and<br>
 was about to begin again when his customer, who decided to keep
the<br>
 talkative man to a certain phase of the subject, now took
command<br>
 of the conversation himself.</p>

<p>"I should think that the people opposite, who live so near
the<br>
 place where the murder was committed, wouldn't be very much
pleased,"<br>
 he said. "I shouldn't care to look out on such a spot every
time<br>
 I went to my window."</p>

<p>"There aren't any windows there," exclaimed the landlord,
"for<br>
 there aren't any houses there. There's only the old garden,
and<br>
 then the large garden and the park belonging to Mr. Thorne's
house,<br>
 that fine old house you see just opposite here. It's a good
thing<br>
 that Mr. Thorne and his wife went away before the murder
became<br>
 known. The lady hasn't been well for some weeks, she's very
nervous<br>
 and frail, and it probably would have frightened her to think
that<br>
 such things were happening right close to her home."</p>

<p>"The lady is sick? What's the matter with her?"</p>

<p>"Goodness knows, nerves, heart trouble, something like that.
The<br>
 things these fine ladies are always having. But she wasn't
always<br>
 that way, not until about a year ago. She was fresh and
blooming<br>
 and very pretty to look at before that."</p>

<p>"She is a young lady then?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, sir; she's very young still and very pretty. It
makes<br>
 you feel sorry to see her so miserable, and you feel sorry for
her<br>
 husband. Now there's a young couple with everything in the
world<br>
 to make them happy and so fond of each other, and the poor
little<br>
 lady has to be so sick."</p>

<p>"They are very happy, you say?" asked Muller carelessly. He
had<br>
 no particular set purpose in following up this inquiry, none
but<br>
 his usual understanding of the fact that a man in his business
can<br>
 never amass too much knowledge, and that it will sometimes
happen<br>
 that a chance bit of information comes in very handy.</p>

<p>The landlord was pleased at the encouragement and continued:
"Indeed<br>
 they are very happy. They've only been married two years. The
lady<br>
 comes from a distance, from Graz. Her father is an army officer
I<br>
 believe, and I don't think she was over-rich. But she's a
very<br>
 sweet-looking lady and her rich husband is very fond of her, any
one<br>
 can see that."</p>

<p>"You said just now that they had gone away, where have they
gone to?"</p>

<p>"They've gone to Italy, sir. Mrs. Thorne was one of the few
people<br>
 who do not know Venice. Franz, that's the butler, sir, told
me<br>
 yesterday evening that he had received a telegram saying that
the<br>
 lady and gentleman had arrived safely and were very
comfortably<br>
 fixed in the Hotel Danieli. You know Danieli's?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do. I also was one of the few people who did not
know<br>
 Venice, that is I was until two years ago. Then, however, I
had<br>
 the pleasure of riding over the Bridge of Mestre," answered
Muller.<br>
 He did not add that he was not alone at the time, but had
ridden<br>
 across the long bridge in company with a pale haggard-faced man
who<br>
 did not dare to look to the right or to the left because of
the<br>
 revolver which he knew was held in the detective's hand under
his<br>
 loose overcoat. Muller's visit to Venice, like most of his<br>
 journeyings, had been one of business. This time to capture
and<br>
 bring home a notorious and long sought embezzler. He did not<br>
 volunteer any of this information, however, but merely asked in
a<br>
 politely interested manner whether the landlord himself had
been<br>
 to Venice.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," replied the latter proudly. "I was head waiter
at<br>
 Baner's for two years."</p>

<p>"Then you must make me some Italian dishes soon," said
Muller.<br>
 Further conversation was interrupted by the entrance of Franz,
the<br>
 old butler of the house opposite.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, sir; I must get him his glass of wine," said
the<br>
 landlord, hurrying away to the bar. He returned in a moment
with<br>
 a small bottle and a glass and set it down on Muller's
table.</p>

<p>"You don't mind, sir, if he sits down here?" he asked. "He
usually<br>
 sits here at this table because then he can see if he is needed
over<br>
 at the house."</p>

<p>"Oh, please let him come here. He has prior rights to this
table<br>
 undoubtedly," said the stranger politely. The old butler sat
down<br>
 with an embarrassed murmur, as the voluble landlord explained
that<br>
 the stranger had no objection. Then the boniface hurried off
to<br>
 attend to some newly entered customers and the detective,
greatly<br>
 pleased at the prospect, found himself alone with the old
servant.</p>

<p>"You come here frequently?" he began, to open the
conversation.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, since my master and myself have settled down here -
we<br>
 travelled most of the time until several years ago - I find
this<br>
 place very convenient. It's a cosy little room, the wine is
good<br>
 and not expensive, I'm near home and yet I can see some new
faces<br>
 occasionally."</p>

<p>"I hope the faces that you see about you at home are not
so<br>
 unpleasant that you are glad to get away from them?" asked
Muller<br>
 with a smile.</p>

<p>The old man gave a start of alarm. "Oh, dear, no, sir," he<br>
 exclaimed eagerly; "that wasn't what I meant. Indeed I'm fond
of<br>
 everybody in the house from our dear lady down to the poor
little<br>
 dog."</p>

<p>Here Muller gained another little bit of knowledge, the fact
that<br>
 the lady of the house was the favourite of her servants, or
that<br>
 she seemed to them even more an object of adoration than the
master.</p>

<p>"Then you evidently have a very good place, since you seem so
fond<br>
 of every one."</p>

<p>"Indeed I have a good place, sir."</p>

<p>"You've had this place a long time?"</p>

<p>"More than twenty years. My master was only eleven years old
when<br>
 I took service with the family."</p>

<p>"Ah, indeed! then you must be a person of importance in the
house<br>
 if you have been there so long?"</p>

<p>"Well more or less I might say I am," the old man smiled
and<br>
 looked flattered, then added: "But the housekeeper, Mrs.
Bernaner,<br>
 is even more important than I am, to tell you the truth. She
was<br>
 nurse to our present young master, and she's been in the house
ever<br>
 since. When his parents died, it's some years ago now, she
took<br>
 entire charge of the housekeeping. She was a fine active
woman<br>
 then, and now the young master and mistress couldn't get
along<br>
 without her. They treat her as if she was one of the
family."</p>

<p>"And she is ill also? I say also," explained Muller, "because
the<br>
 landlord has just been telling me that your mistress is
ill."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, more's the pity! our poor dear young lady has
been<br>
 miserable for nearly a year now. It's a shame to see such a
sweet<br>
 angel as she is suffer like that and the master's quite
heart-broken<br>
 over it. But there's nothing the matter with Mrs. Bernaner.
How<br>
 did you come to think that she was sick?"</p>

<p>Muller did not intend to explain that the change in the
housekeeper's<br>
 appearance, a change which had come about between Tuesday
morning<br>
 and Thursday morning, might easily have made any one think that
she<br>
 was ill. He gave as excuse for his question the old man's own
words:<br>
 "Why, I thought that she might be ill also because you said
yourself<br>
 that the housekeeper - what did you say her name was?"</p>

<p>"Bernauer, Mrs. Adele Bernauer. She was a widow when she came
to<br>
 take care of the master. Her husband was a sergeant of
artillery."</p>

<p>"Well, I mean," continued Muller, "you said yourself that when
the<br>
 gentleman's parents died, Mrs. Bernauer was a fine active
woman,<br>
 therefore I supposed she was no longer so."</p>

<p>Franz thought the matter over for a while. "I don't know just
why<br>
 I put it that way. Indeed she's still as active as ever and
always<br>
 fresh and well. It's true that for the last two or three days
she's<br>
 been very nervous and since yesterday it is as if she was a
changed<br>
 woman. She must be ill, I don't know how to explain it
otherwise."</p>

<p>"What seems to be the matter with her?" asked Muller and then
to<br>
 explain his interest in the housekeeper's health, he fabricated
a<br>
 story: "I studied medicine at one time and although I didn't
finish<br>
 my course or get a diploma, I've always had a great interest in
such<br>
 things, and every now and then I'll take a case,
particularly<br>
 nervous diseases. That was my specialty." Muller took up his
glass<br>
 and turned away from the window, for be felt a slow flush
rising<br>
 to his cheeks. It was another of Muller's peculiarities that
he<br>
 always felt an inward embarrassment at the lies he was obliged
to<br>
 tell in his profession.</p>

<p>The butler did not seem to have noticed it however, and
appeared<br>
 eager to tell of what concerned him in the housekeeper's
appearance<br>
 and demeanour. "Why, yesterday at dinner time was the first
that<br>
 we began to notice anything wrong with Mrs. Bernauer. The rest
of<br>
 us, that is, Lizzie the upstairs girl, the cook and myself.
She<br>
 began to eat her dinner with a good appetite, then suddenly,
when<br>
 we got as far as the pudding, she let her fork fall and
turned<br>
 deathly white. She got up without saying a word and left the
room.<br>
 Lizzie ran after her to ask if anything was the matter, but
she<br>
 said no, it was nothing of importance. After dinner, she went
right<br>
 out, saying she was doing some errands. She brought in a lot
of<br>
 newspapers, which was quite unusual, for she sometimes does not
look<br>
 at a newspaper once a week even. I wouldn't have noticed it
but<br>
 Lizzie's the kind that sees and hears everything and she told
us<br>
 about it." Franz stopped to take a drink, and Muller said<br>
 indifferently, "I suppose Mrs. Bernauer was interested in the
murder<br>
 case. The whole neighbourhood seems to be aroused about it."</p>

<p>"No, I don't think that was it," answered the old servant,
"because<br>
 then she would have sent for a paper this morning too."</p>

<p>"And she didn't do that?"</p>

<p>"No, unless she might have gone out for it herself. There's a
news<br>
 stand right next door here. But I don't think she did because
I<br>
 would have seen the paper around the house then."</p>

<p>"And is that all that's the matter with her?" asked Muller in
a<br>
 tone of disappointment. "Why, I thought you'd have something
really<br>
 interesting to tell me."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, that isn't all, sir," exclaimed the old man
eagerly.</p>

<p>Muller leaned forward, really interested now, while Franz
continued:<br>
 "She was uneasy all the afternoon yesterday. She walked up and
down<br>
 stairs and through the halls - I remember Lizzie making some
joke<br>
 about it - and then in the evening to our surprise she suddenly
began<br>
 a great rummaging in the first story."</p>

<p>"Is that where she lives ?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no; her room is in the wing out towards the garden. The
rooms<br>
 on the first floor all belong to the master and mistress.
This<br>
 morning we found out that Mrs. Bernauer's cleaning up of the
evening<br>
 before had been done because she remembered that the master
wanted<br>
 to take some papers with him but couldn't find them and had
asked<br>
 her to look for them and send them right on."</p>

<p>"Well, I shouldn't call that a sign of any particular
nervousness,<br>
 but rather an evidence of Mrs. Bernaner's devotion to her
duty."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, sir - but it certainly is queer that she should go
into<br>
 the garden at four o'clock this morning and appear to be
looking<br>
 for something along the paths and under the bushes. Even if a
few<br>
 of the papers blew out of the window, or blew away from the
summer<br>
 house, where the master writes sometimes, they couldn't have<br>
 scattered all over the garden like that."</p>

<p>Muller didn't follow up this subject any longer. There might
come<br>
 a time when he would be interested in finding out the reason
for<br>
 the housekeeper's search in the garden, but just at present
he<br>
 wanted something else. He remembered some remark of the old
man's<br>
 about the "poor little dog," and on this he built his plan.</p>

<p>"Oh, well," he said carelessly, "almost everybody is nervous
and<br>
 impatient now-a-days. I suppose Mrs. Bernauer felt uneasy
because<br>
 she couldn't find the paper right away. There's nothing
particularly<br>
 interesting or noticeable about that. Anyway, I've been
occupying<br>
 myself much more these last years with sick animals rather than
with<br>
 sick people. I've had some very successful cures there."</p>

<p>"No, really, have you? Then you could do us a great
favour,"<br>
 exclaimed Franz in apparent eagerness. Muller's heart rejoiced.
He<br>
 had apparently hit it right this time. He knew that in a house
like<br>
 that "a poor dog" could only mean a "sick dog." But his voice
was<br>
 quite calm as he asked: "How can I do you a favour?"</p>

<p>"Why, you see, sir, we've got a little terrier," explained the
old<br>
 man, who had quite forgotten the fact that he had mentioned the
dog<br>
 before. "And there's been something the matter with the poor
little<br>
 chap for several days. He won't eat or drink, he bites at the
grass<br>
 and rolls around on his stomach and cries - it's a pity to see
him.<br>
 If you're fond of animals and know how to take care of them, you
may<br>
 be able to help us there."</p>

<p>"You want me to look at the little dog? Why, yes, I suppose I
can."</p>

<p>"We'll appreciate it," said the old man with an embarrassed
smile.<br>
 But Muller shook his head and continued: "No, never mind the
payment,<br>
 I wouldn't take any money for it. But I'll tell you what you
can<br>
 do for me. I'm very fond of flowers. If you think you can take
the responsibility of letting me<br>
 walk around in the garden for a little<br>
 while, and pick a rose or two, I will be greatly pleased."</p>

<p>"Why, of course you may," said Franz. "Take any of the roses
you<br>
 see there that please you. They're nearly over for the season
now<br>
 and it's better they should be picked rather than left to fade
on<br>
 the bush. We don't use so many flowers in the house now when
the<br>
 family are not there."</p>

<p>"All right, then, it's a bargain," laughed Muller, signalling
to<br>
 the landlord. "Are you, going already?" asked the old
servant.</p>

<p>"Yes, I must be going if I am to spend any time with the
little dog."</p>

<p>"I suppose I ought to be at home myself," said Franz.
"Something's<br>
 the matter with the electric wiring in our place. The bell in
the<br>
 master's room keeps ringing. I wrote to Siemens &amp; Halske to
send us<br>
 a man out to fix it. He's likely to come any minute now." The
two<br>
 men rose, paid their checks, and went out together. Outside
the<br>
 cafe Muller hesitated a moment. "You go on ahead," he said to
Franz.<br>
 "I want to go in here and get a cigar."</p>

<p>While buying his cigar and lighting it, he asked for
several<br>
 newspapers, choosing those which his quick eye had told him were
no<br>
 longer among the piles on the counter. "I'm very sorry, sir,"
said<br>
 the clerk; "we have only a few of those papers, just two or
three<br>
 more than we need for our regular customers, and this morning
they<br>
 are all sold. The housekeeper from the Thorne mansion took the
very<br>
 last ones."</p>

<p>This was exactly what Muller wanted to know. He left the store
and<br>
 caught up with the old butler as the latter was opening the
handsome<br>
 iron gate that led from the Thorne property out onto the
street.</p>

<p><br>
 "Well, where's our little patient?" asked the detective as
he<br>
 walked through the courtyard with Franz.</p>

<p>"You'll see him in a minute," answered the old servant. He
led<br>
 the way through a light roomy corridor furnished with handsome
old<br>
 pieces in empire style, and opened a door at its further
end.</p>

<p>"This is my room."</p>

<p>It was a large light room with two windows opening on the
garden.<br>
 Muller was not at all pleased that the journey through the hall
had<br>
 been such a short one. However he was in the house, that was<br>
 something, and he could afford to trust to chance for the
rest.<br>
 Meanwhile he would look at the dog. The little terrier lay in
a<br>
 corner by the stove and it did not take Muller more than two
or<br>
 three minutes to discover that there was nothing the matter
with<br>
 the small patient but a simple case of over-eating. But he put
on<br>
 a very wise expression as he handled the little dog and looking
up,<br>
 asked if he could get some chamomile tea.</p>

<p>"I'll go for it, I think there's some in the house. Do you
want it<br>
 made fresh?" said Franz.</p>

<p>"Yes, that will be better, about a cupful will do," was
Muller's<br>
 answer. He knew that this harmless remedy would be likely to
do<br>
 the dog good and at the present moment he wanted to be left
alone<br>
 in the room. As soon as Franz had gone, the detective hastened
to<br>
 the window, placing himself behind the curtain so that he
could<br>
 not be seen from outside. He himself could see first a wide<br>
 courtyard lying between the two wings of the house, then beyond
it<br>
 the garden, an immense square plot of ground beautifully
cultivated.<br>
 The left wing of the house was about six windows longer than
the<br>
 other, and from the first story of it it would be quite easy to
look<br>
 out over the vacant lot where the old shed stood which had
served<br>
 as a night's lodging for Johann Knoll.</p>

<p>There was not the slightest doubt in Muller's mind that this
part<br>
 of the tramp's story was true, for by a natural process of<br>
 elimination he knew there was nothing to be gained by inventing
any<br>
 such tale. Besides which the detective himself had been to look
at<br>
 the shed. His well-known pedantic thoroughness would not
permit<br>
 him to take any one's word for anything that he might find out
for<br>
 himself, In his investigations on Tuesday morning he had
already<br>
 seen the half-ruined shed, now he knew that it contained a
broken<br>
 bench.</p>

<p>Thus far, therefore, Knoll's story was proved to be true-but
there<br>
 was something that didn't quite hitch in another way. The tramp
had<br>
 said that he had seen first a woman and then a man come from the
main<br>
 house and go in the direction of the smaller house which he took
to<br>
 be the gardener's dwelling. This Muller discovered now was
quite<br>
 impossible. A tall hedge, fully seven or eight feet high and
very<br>
 thick, stretched from the courtyard far down into the garden
past<br>
 the gardener's little house. There was a broad path on the
right<br>
 and the left of this green wall. From his position in the
shed,<br>
 Knoll could have seen people passing only when they were on
the<br>
 right side of the hedge. But to reach the gardener's house
from<br>
 the main dwelling, the shortest way would be on the left side
of<br>
 the hedge. This much Muller saw, then he heard the butler's
steps<br>
 along the hall and he went back to the corner where the dog
lay.</p>

<p>Franz was not alone. There was some one else with him, the<br>
 housekeeper, Mrs. Bernauer. Just as they opened the door,
Muller<br>
 heard her say: "If the gentleman is a veterinary, then we'd
better<br>
 ask him about the parrot- "</p>

<p>The sentence was never finished. Muller never found out what
was<br>
 the matter with the parrot, for as he looked up with a polite
smile<br>
 of interest, he looked into a pale face, into a pair of eyes
that<br>
 opened wide in terror, and heard trembling lips frame the
words:<br>
 "There he is again!"</p>

<p>A moment later Mrs. Bernauer would have been glad to have
recalled<br>
 her exclamation, but it was too late.</p>

<p>Muller bowed before her and asked: "'There he is again,' you
said;<br>
 have you ever seen me before?"</p>

<p>The woman looked at him as if hypnotised and answered almost
in a<br>
 whisper: "I saw you Tuesday morning for the first time,
Tuesday<br>
 morning when the family were going away. Then I saw you pass<br>
 through our street twice again that same day. This morning you
went<br>
 past the garden gate and now I find you here. What-what is it
you<br>
 want of us?"</p>

<p>"I will tell you what I want, Mrs. Bernauer, but first I want
to<br>
 speak to you alone. Mr. Franz doesn't mind leaving us for a
while,<br>
 does he?"</p>

<p>"But why?" said the old man hesitatingly. He didn't
understand<br>
 at all what was going on and he would much rather have
remained.</p>

<p>"Because I came here for the special purpose of speaking to
Mrs.<br>
 Bernauer," replied Muller calmly.</p>

<p>"Then you didn't come on account of the dog?"</p>

<p>"No, I didn't come on account of the dog."</p>

<p>"Then you - you lied to me?"</p>

<p>"Partly."</p>

<p>"And you're no veterinary?"</p>

<p>"No - I can help your dog, but I am not a veterinary and never
have<br>
 been."</p>

<p>"What are you then?"</p>

<p>"I will tell Mrs. Bernauer who and what I am when you are
outside<br>
 - outside in the courtyard there. You can walk about in the
garden<br>
 if you want to, or else go and get some simple purgative for
this<br>
 dog. That is all he needs; he has been over-fed."</p>

<p>Franz was quite bewildered. These new developments promised to
be<br>
 interesting and he was torn between his desire to know more,
and<br>
 his doubts as to the propriety of leaving the housekeeper with
this<br>
 queer stranger. He hesitated until the woman herself motioned
to<br>
 him to go. He went out into the hall, then into the
courtyard,<br>
 watched by the two in the room who stood silently in the
window<br>
 until they saw the butler pass down into the garden. Then
they<br>
 looked at each other.</p>

<p>"You belong to the police?" asked Adele Bernauer finally with
a<br>
 deep sigh.</p>

<p>"That was a good guess," replied Muller with an ironic
smile,<br>
 adding: "All who have any reason to fear us are very quick
in<br>
 recognising us."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that?" she exclaimed with a start.
"What<br>
 are you thinking of?"</p>

<p>"I am thinking about the same thing that you are thinking of -
that<br>
 I have proved you are thinking of - the same thing that drove
you<br>
 out into the street yesterday and this morning to buy the
papers.<br>
 These papers print news which is interesting many people just
now,<br>
 and some people a great deals. I am thinking of the same
thing<br>
 that was evidently in your thoughts as you peered out of the
garden<br>
 gate this morning, although you would not come out into the
street.<br>
 I know that you do not read even one newspaper regularly. I
know<br>
 also that yesterday and today you bought a great many
papers,<br>
 apparently to get every possible detail about a certain
subject.<br>
 Do you deny this?"</p>

<p>She did not deny it, she did not answer at all. She sank down
on<br>
 a chair, her wide staring eyes looking straight ahead of her,
and<br>
 trembling so that the old chair cracked underneath her weight.
But<br>
 this condition did not last long. The woman had herself well
under<br>
 control. Muller's coming, or something else, perhaps, may
have<br>
 overwhelmed her for a moment, but she soon regained her
usual<br>
 self-possession.</p>

<p>"Still you have not told me what you want here," she began
coldly,<br>
 and as he did not answer she continued: "I have a feeling that
you<br>
 are watching us. I had this feeling when I saw you the first
time<br>
 and noticed then - pardon my frankness - that you stared at
us<br>
 sharply while we were saying goodbye to our master and
mistress.<br>
 Then I saw you pass twice again through the street and look up
at<br>
 our windows. This morning I find you at our garden gate and<br>
 now - you will pardon me if I tell the exact truth - now you
have<br>
 wormed yourself in here under false pretenses because you have
no<br>
 right whatever to force an entrance into this house. And I
ask<br>
 you again, what do you want here?"</p>

<p>Muller was embarrassed. That did not happen very often. Also
it<br>
 did not happen very often that he was in the wrong as he was
now.<br>
 The woman was absolutely right. He had wormed himself into
the<br>
 house under false pretenses to follow up the new clue which
almost<br>
 unconsciously as yet was leading him on with a stronger and
stronger<br>
 attraction. He could not have explained it and he certainly was
not<br>
 ready to say anything about it at police headquarters, even at
the<br>
 risk of being obliged to continue to enter this mysterious
house<br>
 under false pretenses and to be told that he was doing so.
Of<br>
 course this sort of thing was necessary in his business, it
was<br>
 the only way in which he could follow up the criminals.</p>

<p>But there was something in this woman's words that cut into
a<br>
 sensitive spot and drove the blood to his cheeks. There was<br>
 something in the bearing and manner of this one-time nurse
that<br>
 impressed him, although he was not a man to be lightly
impressed.<br>
 He had a feeling that be had made a fool of himself and it
bothered<br>
 him. For a moment he did not know what he should say to this
woman<br>
 who stood before him with so much quiet energy in her bearing.
But<br>
 the something in his brain, the something that made him what he
was,<br>
 whispered to him that he had done right, and that he must
follow<br>
 up the trail he had found. That gave him back his usual
calm.</p>

<p>He took up his hat, and standing before the pale-faced
woman,<br>
 looking her firmly in the eyes, he said: "It is true that I
have<br>
 no right as yet to force my way into your house, therefore I
have<br>
 been obliged to enter it as best I could. I have done this
often<br>
 in my work, but I do it for the safety of society. And those
who<br>
 reproach me for doing it are generally those whom I have
been<br>
 obliged to persecute in the name of the law. Mrs. Bernauer,
I<br>
 will confess that there are moments in which I feel ashamed that
I<br>
 have chosen this profession that compels me to hunt down
human<br>
 beings. But I do not believe that this is one of those
moments.<br>
 You have read this morning's papers; you must know, therefore,
that<br>
 a man has been arrested and accused of the murder which
interests<br>
 you so much; you must be able to realise the terror and
anxiety<br>
 which are now filling this man's heart. For to-day's papers -
I<br>
 have read them myself - expressed the public sentiment that
the<br>
 police may succeed in convicting this man of the crime, that
the<br>
 death may be avenged and justice have her due. Several of
these<br>
 papers, the papers I know you have bought and presumably read,
do<br>
 not doubt that Johann Knoll is the murderer of Leopold
Winkler.</p>

<p>"Now there are at least two people who do not believe that
Knoll is<br>
 the murderer. I am one of them, and you, Mrs. Bernauer, you
are<br>
 the other. I am going now and when I come again, as I
doubtless<br>
 will come again, I will come with full right to enter this
house.<br>
 I acknowledge frankly that I have no justification in causing
your<br>
 arrest as yet, but you are quite clever enough to know that if
I<br>
 had the faintest justification I would not leave here alone.
And<br>
 one thing more I have to say. You may not know that I have had
the<br>
 most extraordinary luck in my profession, that in more than
a<br>
 hundred cases there have been but two where the criminal I
was<br>
 hunting escaped me. And now, Mrs. Bernauer, I will bid you
good<br>
 day."</p>

<p>Muller stepped towards the window and motioned to Franz, who
was<br>
 walking up and down outside. The old man ran to the door and
met<br>
 the detective in the hall.</p>

<p>"You'd better go in and look after Mrs. Bernauer," said
the<br>
 latter, "I can find my way out alone."</p>

<p>Franz looked after him, shaking his head in bewilderment and
then<br>
 entered his own room. "Merciful God!" he exclaimed, bending
down<br>
 in terror over the housekeeper, who lay on the floor. In his
shock<br>
 and bewilderment he imagined that she too had been murdered,
until<br>
 he realised that it was only a swoon from which she recovered
in<br>
 a moment. He helped her regain her feet and she looked about
as<br>
 if still dazed, stammering: "Has he gone?"</p>

<p>"The strange man? ... Yes, he went some time ago. But what<br>
 happened to you? Did he give you something to make you faint?
Do<br>
 you think he was a thief?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Bernauer shook her head and murmured: "Oh, no, quite
the<br>
 contrary." A remark which did not enlighten Franz
particularly<br>
 as to the status of the man who had just left them. There was
a<br>
 note of fear in the housekeepers s voice and she added
hastily:<br>
 "Does any one besides ourselves know that he was here?"</p>

<p>No. Lizzie and the cook are in the kitchen talking about
the<br>
 murder."</p>

<p>Mrs. Bernauer shivered again and went slowly out of the room
and<br>
 up the stairs.</p>

<p>If Franz believed that the stranger had left the house by
the<br>
 front entrance he was very much mistaken. When Muller found<br>
 himself alone in the corridor he turned quickly and hurried
out<br>
 into the garden. None of the servants had seen him. Lizzie
and<br>
 the cook were engaged in an earnest conversation in the
kitchen<br>
 and Franz was fully occupied with Mrs. Bernauer. The
gardener<br>
 was away and his wife busy at her wash tubs. No one was
aware,<br>
 therefore, that Muller spent about ten minutes wandering about
the<br>
 garden, and ten minutes were quite sufficient for him to become
so<br>
 well acquainted with the place that he could have drawn a map
of<br>
 it. He left the garden through the rear gate, the latch of
which<br>
 he was obliged to leave open. The gardener's wife found it
that<br>
 way several hours later and was rather surprised thereat.
Muller<br>
 walked down the street rapidly and caught a passing tramway.
His<br>
 mood was not of the best, for he could not make up his mind
whether<br>
 or no this morning had been a lost one. His mind sorted and<br>
 rearranged all that he knew or could imagine concerning Mrs.<br>
 Bernaner. But there was hardly enough of these facts to
reassure<br>
 him that he was not on a false trail, that he had not
allowed<br>
 himself to waste precious hours all because he had seen a
woman's<br>
 haggard face appear for a moment at the little gate in the quiet
street.</p>

<h2><br>
 CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>JOHANN KNOLL REMEMBERS SOMETHING ELSE</h3>

<p><br>
 Muller's goal was the prison where Johann Knoll was awaiting
his<br>
 fate. The detective had permission to see the man as often
as<br>
 he wished to. Knoll had been proven a thief, but the
accusation<br>
 of murder against him had not been strengthened by anything
but<br>
 the most superficial circumstantial evidence, therefore it
was<br>
 necessary that Muller should talk with him in the hope of<br>
 discovering something more definite.</p>

<p>Knoll lay asleep on his cot as the detective and the warder
entered<br>
 the cell. Muller motioned the attendant to leave him alone
with<br>
 the prisoner and he stood beside the cot looking down at the
man.<br>
 The face on the hard pillow was not a very pleasant one to look
at.<br>
 The skin was roughened and swollen and had that brown-purple
tinge<br>
 which comes from being constantly in the open air, and from
habitual<br>
 drinking. The weather-beaten look may be seen often in the faces
of<br>
 men whose honest work keeps them out of doors; but this man had
not<br>
 earned his colouring honestly, for he was one of the sort who
worked<br>
 only from time to time when it was absolutely necessary and
there<br>
 was no other way of getting a penny. His hands proved this,
for<br>
 although soiled and grimy they had soft, slender fingers
which<br>
 showed no signs of a life of toil. But even a man who has
spent<br>
 forty years in useless idling need not be all bad. There must
have<br>
 been some good left in this man or he could not have lain there
so<br>
 quietly, breathing easily, wrapped in a slumber as undisturbed
as<br>
 that of a child. It did not seem possible that any man could
lie<br>
 there like that with the guilt of murder on his conscience, or
even<br>
 with the knowledge in his soul that he had plundered a
corpse.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><br>
 Muller had never believed the first to be the case, but he
had<br>
 thought it possible that Knoll knew perfectly well that it was
a<br>
 lifeless body he was robbing. He had believed it at least
until<br>
 the moment when he stood looking down at the sleeping tramp.
Now,<br>
 with the deep knowledge of the human heart which was his by<br>
 instinct and which his profession had increased a
thousand-fold,<br>
 Muller knew that this man before him had no heavy crime upon
his<br>
 conscience - that it was really as he had said - that he had
taken<br>
 the watch and purse from one whom he believed to be
intoxicated<br>
 only. Of course it was not a very commendable deed for which
the<br>
 tramp was now in prison, but it was slight in comparison to
the<br>
 crimes of which he was suspected.</p>

<p>Muller bent lower over the unconscious form and was surprised
to<br>
 see a gentle smile spread over the face before him. It
brightened<br>
 and changed the coarse rough face and gave it for a moment a
look<br>
 of almost child-like innocence. Somewhere within the
coarsened<br>
 soul there must be a spot of brightness from which such a
smile<br>
 could come.</p>

<p>But the face grew ugly again as Knoll opened his eyes and
looked<br>
 up. He shook off the clouds of slumber as he felt Muller's
hand<br>
 on his shoulder and raised himself to a sitting position,
grumbling:<br>
 "Can't I have any rest? Are they going to question me again?
I'm<br>
 getting tired of this. I've said everything I know anyhow."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not everything. Perhaps you will answer a few of
my<br>
 questions when I tell you that I believe the story you told
us<br>
 yesterday, and that I want to be your friend and help you."</p>

<p>Knoll's little eyes glanced up without embarrassment at the
man<br>
 who spoke to him. They were sharp eyes and had a certain spark
of<br>
 intelligence in them. Muller had noticed that yesterday, and
he<br>
 saw it again now. But he saw also the gleam of distrust in
these<br>
 eyes, a distrust which found expression in Knoll's next
words.<br>
 "You think you can catch me with your good words, but you're
makin'<br>
 a mistake. I've got nothin' new to say. And you needn't
think<br>
 that you can blind me, I know you're one of the police, and
I'm<br>
 not going to say anything at all."</p>

<p>"Just as you like. I was trying to help you, I believe I
really<br>
 could help you. I have just come from Hietzing - but of course
if<br>
 you don't want to talk to me - " Muller shrugged his shoulders
and<br>
 turned toward the door.</p>

<p>But before he reached it Knoll stood at his side. "You really
mean<br>
 to help me?" he gasped.</p>

<p>"I do," said the detective calmly.</p>

<p>"Then swear, on your mother's soul - or is your mother still
alive?"</p>

<p>"No, she has been dead some time."</p>

<p>"Well, then, will you swear it?"</p>

<p>"Would you believe an oath like that?"</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't I?"</p>

<p>"With the life you've been leading?"</p>

<p>"My life's no worse than a lot of others. Stealing those
things on<br>
 Monday was the worst thing I've done yet. Will you swear?"</p>

<p>"Is it something so very important you have to tell me?"</p>

<p>"No, I ain't got nothin' at all new to tell you. But I'd just
like<br>
 to know - in this black hole I've got into - I'd just like to
know<br>
 that there's one human being who means well with me - I'd like
to<br>
 know that there's one man in the world who don't think I'm
quite<br>
 good-for-nothin'."</p>

<p>The tramp covered his face with his hands and gave a
heart-rending<br>
 sob. Deep pity moved the detective's breast. He led Knoll back
to<br>
 his cot, and put both hands on his shoulders, saying gravely:
"I<br>
 believe that this theft was the worst thing you have done. By
my<br>
 mother's salvation, Knoll, I believe your words and I will try
to<br>
 help you."</p>

<p>Knoll raised his head, looking up at Muller with a glance
of<br>
 unspeakable gratitude. With trembling lips he kissed the
hand<br>
 which a moment before had pressed kindly on his shoulder,
clinging<br>
 fast to it as if he could not bear to let it go. Muller was
almost<br>
 embarrassed. "Oh, come now, Knoll, don't be foolish. Pull
yourself<br>
 together and answer my questions carefully, for I am asking
you<br>
 these questions more for your own sake than for anything
else."</p>

<p>The tramp nodded and wiped the tears from his face. He
looked<br>
 almost happy again, and there was a softness in his eyes
that<br>
 showed there was something in the man which might be saved
and<br>
 which was worth saving.</p>

<p>Muller sat beside him on the cot and began: "There was one
mistake<br>
 in your story yesterday. I want you to think it over
carefully.<br>
 You said that you saw first a woman and then a man going
through<br>
 the neighbouring garden. I believe that one or both of these<br>
 people is the criminal for whom we are looking. Therefore, I
want<br>
 you to try and remember everything that you can connect with
them,<br>
 every slightest detail. Anything that you can tell us may be
of<br>
 the greatest importance. Therefore, think very carefully."</p>

<p>Knoll sat still a few moments, evidently trying hard to put
his<br>
 hazy recollections into useful form and shape. But it was
also<br>
 evident that orderly thinking was an unusual work for him, and
he<br>
 found it almost too difficult. "I guess you 'better ask me<br>
 questions, maybe that'll go," he said after a pause.</p>

<p>Then Muller began to question. With his usual thoroughness
he<br>
 began at the very beginning: "When was it that you climbed
the<br>
 fence to get into the shed?"</p>

<p>"It just struck nine o'clock when I put my foot on the lowest
bar."</p>

<p>"Are you sure of that?"</p>

<p>"Quite sure. I counted every stroke. You see, I wanted to
know<br>
 how long the night was going to be, seein' I'd have to sleep
in<br>
 that shed. I was in the garden just exactly an hour. I came
out<br>
 of the shed as it struck ten and it wasn't but a few minutes
before<br>
 I was in the street again."</p>

<p>"And when was it that you saw the woman in the garden next
door?"</p>

<p>"H'm, I don't just know when that was. I'd been in on the
bench<br>
 quite a while."</p>

<p>"And the man? When did you see the man?"</p>

<p>"He came past a few minutes after the woman had gone towards
the<br>
 little house in the garden."</p>

<p>"Ah! there you see, that's where you made your mistake. It
is<br>
 more than likely that these two did not go to the little house,
but<br>
 that they went somewhere else. Did they walk slowly and
quietly?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it. They ran almost ... Went past as quick as a
bat<br>
 in the night."</p>

<p>"Then they both appeared to be in a hurry?"</p>

<p>"Yes indeed they did."</p>

<p>"Ah, ha, you see! Now when any one's in a hurry he doesn't go
the<br>
 longest way round, as a rule. And it would have been the
longest<br>
 way round for these two people to go from the big house to
the<br>
 gardener's cottage - for the little house you saw was the
gardener's<br>
 cottage. There is tall thick hedge that starts from the main<br>
 building and goes right down through the garden, quite a
distance<br>
 past the gardener's cottage. The vegetable garden is on the
left<br>
 side of this hedge and in the middle of the vegetable garden is
the<br>
 gardener's cottage. But you could have seen the man and the
woman<br>
 only because they passed down the right side of the hedge, and
this<br>
 would have given them a detour of fifty paces or more to
reach<br>
 the gardener's house. Nov do you think that two people who
were<br>
 very much in a hurry would have gone down the right side of
the<br>
 hedge, to reach a place which they could have gotten to much
quicker<br>
 on the left side?"</p>

<p>"No, that would have been a fool thing to do."</p>

<p>"And you are quite sure that these people were in a
hurry?"</p>

<p>"That's dead sure. I scarcely saw them before they'd gone
again."</p>

<p>"And you didn't see them come back?"</p>

<p>"No, at least I didn't pay any further attention to them. When
I<br>
 thought it wouldn't be any good to look about in there I
turned<br>
 around and dozed off."</p>

<p>"And it was during this dozing that you thought you heard the
shot?"</p>

<p>Yes, sir, that's right."</p>

<p>"And you didn't notice anything else? You didn't hear
anything<br>
 else."</p>

<p>"No, nothin' at all, there was so much noise anyway. There was
a<br>
 high wind that night and the trees were rattling and
creaking."</p>

<p>"And you didn't see anything else, anything that attracted
your<br>
 attention?"</p>

<p>"No, nothing - " Knoll did not finish his sentence, but
began<br>
 another instead. He had suddenly remembered something which
had<br>
 seemed to him of no importance before. "There was a light
that<br>
 went out suddenly."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"In the side of the house that I could see from my place.
There<br>
 was a lamp in the last window of the second story, a lamp with
a<br>
 red shade. That lamp went out all at once."</p>

<p>"Was the window open?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"There was a strong wind that night, might not the wind have
blown<br>
 the lamp out?"</p>

<p>"No, that wasn't it," said Knoll, rising hastily.</p>

<p>"Well, how was it?" asked Muller calmly.</p>

<p>"A hand put out the lamp."</p>

<p>"Whose hand?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't see that. The light was so low on account of the
shade<br>
 that I couldn't see the person who stood there."</p>

<p>"And you don't know whether it was a man or a woman?"</p>

<p>"No, I just saw a hand, more like a shadow it was."</p>

<p>"Well, it doesn't matter much anyway. It was after nine
o'clock<br>
 and many people go to bed about that time," said Muller, who
did<br>
 not see much value in this incident.</p>

<p>But Knoll shook his head. "The person who put out that light
didn't<br>
 go to bed, at least not right away," he said eagerly. "I
looked<br>
 over after a while to the place where the red light was and I
saw<br>
 something else."</p>

<p>"Well, what was it you saw?"</p>

<p>"The window had been closed."</p>

<p>"Who closed it? Didn't you see the person that time? The
moonlight<br>
 lay full on the house."</p>

<p>"Yes, when there weren't any clouds. But there was a heavy
cloud<br>
 over the moon just then and when it came out again the window
was<br>
 shut and there was a white curtain drawn in front of it."</p>

<p>"How could you see that?"</p>

<p>"I could see it when the lamp was lit again."</p>

<p>"Then the lamp was lit again?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I could see the red light behind the curtain."</p>

<p>"And what happened then?"</p>

<p>"Nothing more then, except that the man went through the
garden."</p>

<p>Muller rose now and took up his hat. He was evidently excited
and<br>
 Knoll looked at him uneasily. "You're goin' already?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, I have a great deal to do to-day," replied the detective
and<br>
 nodded to the prisoner as he knocked on the door. "I am glad
you<br>
 remembered that," he added, "it will be of use to us, I
think."</p>

<p>The warder opened the door, let Muller out, and the heavy
iron<br>
 portal clanged again between Knoll and freedom.</p>

<p>Muller was quite satisfied with the result of his visit to
the<br>
 accused. He hurried to the nearest cab stand and entered one
of<br>
 the carriages waiting there. He gave the driver Mrs.
Klingmayer's<br>
 address. It was about two o'clock in the afternoon now and
Muller<br>
 had had nothing to eat yet. But he was quite unaware of the
fact<br>
 as his mind was so busy that no mere physical sensation
could<br>
 divert his attention for a moment. Muller never seemed to
need<br>
 sleep or food when he was on the trail, particularly not in
the<br>
 fascinating first stages of the case when it was his
imagination<br>
 alone, catching at trifles unnoticed by others, combining them
in<br>
 masterly fashion to an ordered whole, that first led the
seekers<br>
 to the truth. Now he went over once more all the little
apparently<br>
 trivial incidents that had caused him first to watch the
Thorne<br>
 household and then had drawn his attention, and his
suspicion,<br>
 to Adele Bernauer. It was the broken willow twig that had
first<br>
 drawn his attention to the old garden next the Thorne
property.<br>
 This twig, this garden, and perhaps some one who could reach
his<br>
 home again, unseen and unendangered through this garden -
might<br>
 not this have something to do with the murder?</p>

<p>The breaking of the twig was already explained. It was
Johann<br>
 Knoll who had stepped on it. But he had not climbed the wall
at<br>
 all, had only crept along it looking for a night's shelter.
And<br>
 there was no connection between Knoll and the people who
lived<br>
 in the Thorne house. Muller had not the slightest doubt that
the<br>
 tramp had told the entire truth that day and the day
preceding.</p>

<p><br>
 Then the detective's mind went back to the happenings of
Tuesday<br>
 morning. The little twig had first drawn his attention to
the<br>
 Thorne estate and the people who lived there. He had seen
the<br>
 departure of the young couple and had passed the house again
that<br>
 afternoon and the following day, drawn to it as if by a
magnet.<br>
 He had not been able then to explain what it was that
attracted<br>
 him; there had been nothing definite in his mind as he
strolled<br>
 past the old mansion. But his repeated appearance had been
noticed<br>
 by some one - by one person only - the housekeeper. Why should
she<br>
 have noticed it? Had she any reason for believing that she
might<br>
 be watched? People with an uneasy conscience are very apt to<br>
 connect even perfectly natural trivial circumstances with their
own<br>
 doings. Adele Bernauer had evidently connected Muller's
repeated<br>
 passing with something that concerned herself even before
the<br>
 detective had thought of her at all.</p>

<p>Muller had not noticed her until he had seen her peculiar
conduct<br>
 that very morning. When he heard Franz's words and saw how<br>
 disturbed the woman was, he asked himself: "Why did this
woman<br>
 want to be shown the spot of the murder? Didn't she know
that<br>
 place, living so near it, as well as any of the many who
stood<br>
 there staring in morbid curiosity? Did she ask to have it
shown<br>
 her that the others might believe she had nothing whatever to
do<br>
 with the occurrences that had happened there? Or was she
drawn<br>
 thither by that queer attraction that brings the criminal back
to<br>
 the scene of his crime?"</p>

<p>The sudden vision of Mrs. Bernauer's head at the garden gate,
and<br>
 its equally sudden disappearance had attracted Muller's
attention<br>
 and his thoughts to the woman. What he had been able to
learn<br>
 about her had increased his suspicions and her involuntary<br>
 exclamation when she met him face to face in the house had
proved<br>
 beyond a doubt that there was something on her mind. His
open<br>
 accusation, her demeanour, and finally her swoon, were all links
in<br>
 the chain of evidence that this woman knew something about
the<br>
 murder in the quiet lane.</p>

<p>With this suspicion in his mind what Muller had learned from
Knoll<br>
 was of great value to him, at all events of great interest.
Was<br>
 it the housekeeper who had put out the light? For now Muller
did<br>
 not doubt for a moment that this sudden extinguishing of the
lamp<br>
 was a signal. He believed that Knoll had seen clearly and that
he<br>
 had told truly what he had seen. A lamp that is blown out by
the<br>
 wind flickers uneasily before going out. A sudden extinguishing
of<br>
 the light means human agency. And the lamp was lit again a
few<br>
 moments afterward and burned on steadily as before. A short
time<br>
 after the lamp had been put out the man had been seen going
through<br>
 the garden. And it could not have been much later before the
shot<br>
 was heard. This shot had been fired between the hours of nine
and<br>
 ten, for it was during this hour only that Knoll was in the
garden<br>
 house and heard the shot. But it was not necessary to depend
upon<br>
 the tramp's evidence alone to determine the exact hour of the
shot.<br>
 It must have been before half past nine, or otherwise the
janitor<br>
 of No.1, who came home at that hour and lay awake so long,
would<br>
 undoubtedly have heard a shot fired so near his domicile, in
spite<br>
 of the noise occasioned by the high wind. There would have
been<br>
 sufficient time for Mrs. Bernauer to have reached the place of
the<br>
 murder between the putting out of the lamp and the firing of
the<br>
 shot. But perhaps she may have rested quietly in her room;
she<br>
 may have been only the inciter or the accomplice of the deed.
But<br>
 at all events, she knew something about it, she was in some
way<br>
 connected with it.</p>

<p>Muller drew a deep breath. He felt much easier now that he
had<br>
 arranged his thoughts and marshalled in orderly array all the
facts<br>
 he had already gathered. There was nothing to do now but to
follow<br>
 up a given path step by step and he could no longer reproach
himself<br>
 that he might have cast suspicion on an innocent soul. No,
his<br>
 bearing towards Mrs. Bernauer had not been sheer brutality.
His<br>
 instinct, which had led him so unerringly so many times, had
again<br>
 shown him the right way when he had thrust the accusation in
her<br>
 face.</p>

<p>Now that his mind was easier he realised that he was very
hungry.<br>
 He drove to a restaurant and ordered a hasty meal.</p>

<p>"Beer, sir?' asked the waiter for the third time.</p>

<p>"No," answered Muller, also for the third time.</p>

<p>"Then you'll take wine, sir?" asked the insistent
Ganymede.</p>

<p>"Oh, go to the devil! When I want anything I'll ask for
it,"<br>
 growled the detective, this time effectively scaring the
waiter.<br>
 It did not often happen that a customer refused drinks, but
then<br>
 there were not many customers who needed as clear, a head as<br>
 Muller knew he would have to have to-day. Always a light
drinker,<br>
 it was one of his rules never to touch a drop of liquor
during<br>
 this first stage of the mental working out of any new
problem<br>
 which presented itself. But soft-hearted as he was, he
repented<br>
 of his irritation a moment later and soothed the waiter's
wounded<br>
 feelings by a rich tip. The boy ran out to open the cab door
for<br>
 his strange customer and looked after him, wondering whether
the<br>
 man was a cranky millionaire or merely a poet. For Joseph<br>
 Muller, by name and by reputation one of the best known men
in<br>
 Vienna, was by sight unknown to all except the few with whom
he<br>
 had to do on the police force. His appearance, in every way<br>
 inconspicuous, and the fact that he never sought acquaintance
with<br>
 any one, was indeed of the greatest possible assistance to him
in<br>
 his work. Many of those who saw him several times in a day
would<br>
 pass him or look him full in the face without recognising him.
It<br>
 was only, as in the case of Mrs. Bernauer, the guilty
conscience<br>
 that remembered face and figure of this quiet-looking man who
was<br>
 one of the most-feared servants of the law in Austria.</p>

<h2><br>
 CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>THE ELECTRICIAN</h3>

<p><br>
 When Muller reached the house where Mrs. Klingmayer lived he
ordered<br>
 the cabman to wait and hurried up to the widow's little
apartment.<br>
 He had the key to Leopold Winkler's room in his own pocket,
for<br>
 Mrs. Klingmayer had given this key to Commissioner von Riedau
at<br>
 the latter's request and the commissioner had given it to
Muller.<br>
 The detective told the good woman not to bother about him as
he<br>
 wanted to make an examination of the place alone. Left to
himself<br>
 in the little room, Muller made a thorough search of it,
opening<br>
 the cupboard, the bureau drawers, every possible receptacle
where<br>
 any article could be kept or hidden. What he wanted to find
was<br>
 some letter, some bit of paper, some memoranda perhaps,
anything<br>
 that would show any connection existing between the murdered
man<br>
 and Mrs. Bernauer, who lived so near the place where this man
had<br>
 died and who was so greatly interested in his murder.</p>

<p><br>
 The detective's search was not quite in vain, although he could
not<br>
 tell yet whether what he had found would be of any value.
Leopold<br>
 Winkler had had very little correspondence, or else he had had
no<br>
 reason to keep the letters he received. Muller found only about
a<br>
 half dozen letters in all. Three of them were from women of
the<br>
 half-world, giving dates for meetings. Another was written by
a<br>
 man and signed "Theo." This "Theo" appeared to be the same
sort<br>
 of a cheap rounder that Winkler was. And he seemed to have
sunk<br>
 one grade deeper than the dead man, in spite of the latter's
bad<br>
 reputation. For this other addressed Winkler as his "Dear
Friend"<br>
 and pleaded with him for "greater discretion," alluding
evidently<br>
 to something which made this discretion necessary.</p>

<p>"I wonder what rascality it was that made these two
friends?"<br>
 murmured Muller, putting "Theo's letter with the three he
had<br>
 already read. But before he slipped it in his pocket he glanced
at<br>
 the postmark. The letters of the three women had all been
posted<br>
 from different quarters of the city some months ago. Theo's
letter<br>
 was postmarked "Marburg," and dated on the 1st of September
of<br>
 the present year.</p>

<p>Then Muller looked at the postmark of the two remaining
letters<br>
 which he had not yet read, and whistled softly to himself.
Both<br>
 these letters were posted from a certain station in Hietzing,
the<br>
 station which was nearest his own lodgings and also nearest
the<br>
 Thorne house. He looked at the postmark more sharply. They
both<br>
 bore the dates of the present year, one of them being stamped
"March<br>
 17th," the other "September 24th." This last letter
interested<br>
 the detective most.</p>

<p>Muller was not of a nervous disposition, but his hand
trembled<br>
 slightly as he took the letter from its envelope. It was
clear<br>
 that this letter had been torn open hastily, for the edges of
the<br>
 opening were jagged and uneven.</p>

<p>When the detective had read the letter - it contained but a
few<br>
 lines and bore neither address nor signature - he glanced
over<br>
 it once more as if to memorise the words. They were as
follows:<br>
 "Do not come again. In a day or two I will be able to do what
I<br>
 have to do. I will send you later news to your office.
Impatience<br>
 will not help you." - These words were written hastily on a
piece<br>
 of paper that looked as if it had been torn from a pad. In
spite<br>
 of the haste the writer had been at some pains to disguise
the<br>
 handwriting. But it was a clumsy disguise, done by one not<br>
 accustomed to such tricks, and it was evidently done by a
woman.<br>
 All she had known how to do to disguise her writing had been
to<br>
 twist and turn the paper while writing, so that every letter
had<br>
 a different position. The letters were also made unusually
long.<br>
 This peculiarity of the writing was seen on both letters and
both<br>
 envelopes. The earlier letter was still shorter and seemed to
have<br>
 been written with the same haste, and with the same disgust,
or<br>
 perhaps even hatred, for the man to whom it was written.</p>

<p>"Come to-morrow, but not before eight o'clock. He has gone
away.<br>
 God forgive him and you." This was the contents of the letter
of<br>
 the 17th of March. That is, the writer had penned the letter
this<br>
 way. But the last two words, "and you," had evidently not
come<br>
 from her heart, for she had annulled them by a heavy stroke of
the<br>
 pen. A stroke that seemed like a knife thrust, so full of
rage<br>
 and hate it was.</p>

<p>"So he was called to a rendezvous in Hietzing, too,"
murmured<br>
 Muller, then he added after a few moments: "But this rendezvous
had<br>
 nothing whatever to do with love."</p>

<p>There was nothing else in Winkler's room which could be of any
value<br>
 to Muller in the problem that was now before him. And yet he
was<br>
 very well satisfied with the result of his errand.</p>

<p>He entered his cab again, ordering the driver to take him
to<br>
 Hietzing. Just before he had reached the corner where he had
told<br>
 the man to stop, another cab passed them, a coupe, in which was
a<br>
 solitary woman. Muller had just time enough to recognise this
woman<br>
 as Adele Bernauer, and to see that she looked even more haggard
and<br>
 miserable than she had that morning. She did not look up as
the<br>
 other cab passed her carriage, therefore she did not see
Muller.<br>
 The detective looked at his watch and saw that it was almost<br>
 half-past four. The unexpected meeting changed, his plans for
the<br>
 afternoon. He had decided that he must enter the Thorne
mansion<br>
 again that very day, for he must find out the meaning of the<br>
 red-shaded lamp. And now that the housekeeper was away it
would<br>
 be easier for him to get into the house, therefore it must be
done<br>
 at once. His excuse was all ready, for he had been weighing<br>
 possibilities. He dismissed his cab a block from his own home
and<br>
 entered his house cautiously.</p>

<p>Muller's lodgings consisted of two large rooms, really much
too<br>
 large for a lone man who was at home so little. But Muller
had<br>
 engaged them at first sight, for the apartment possessed one<br>
 qualification which was absolutely necessary for him. Its<br>
 situation and the arrangement of its doors made it possible
for<br>
 him to enter and leave his rooms without being seen either by
his<br>
 own landlady or by the other lodgers in the house. The
little<br>
 apartment was on the ground floor, and Muller's own rooms had
a<br>
 separate entrance opening on to the main corridor almost
immediately<br>
 behind the door. Nine times out of ten, he could come and go<br>
 without being seen by any one in the house. To-day was the
first<br>
 time, however, that Muller had had occasion to try this
particular<br>
 qualification of his new lodgings.</p>

<p>He opened the street door and slipped into his own room
without<br>
 having seen or been seen by any one.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later he left the apartment again, but left
it<br>
 such a changed man that nobody who had seen him go in would
have<br>
 recognised him. Before he came out, however, he looked about<br>
 carefully to see whether there was any one in sight He came
out<br>
 unseen and was just closing the main door behind him, when he
met<br>
 the janitress.</p>

<p>"Were you looking for anybody in the house?" said the
woman,<br>
 glancing sharply at the stranger, who answered in a slightly
veiled<br>
 voice: "No, I made a mistake in the number. The place I am
looking<br>
 for is two houses further down."</p>

<p>He walked down the street and the woman looked after him until
she<br>
 saw him turn into the doorway of the second house. Then she
went<br>
 into her own rooms. The house Muller entered happened to be
a<br>
 corner house with an entrance on the other street, through
which<br>
 the detective passed and went on his way. He was quite
satisfied<br>
 with the security of his disguise, for the woman who knew him
well<br>
 had not recognised him at all. If his own janitress did not
know<br>
 him, the people in the Thorne house would never imagine it was
he.</p>

<p>And indeed Muller was entirely changed. In actuality small
and<br>
 thin, with sparse brown hair and smooth shaven face, he was now
an<br>
 inch or two taller and very much stouter. He wore thick curly
blond<br>
 hair, a little pointed blond beard and moustache. His eyes
were<br>
 hidden by heavy-rimmed spectacles.</p>

<p>It was just half-past five when he rang the bell at the
entrance<br>
 gate to the Thorne property. He had spent the intervening time
in<br>
 the cafe, as he was in no hurry to enter the house. Franz came
down<br>
 the path and opened the door. "'What do you want?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I come from Siemens &amp; Halske; I was to ask whether the
other man - "</p>

<p>"Has been here already?" interrupted Franz, adding in an
irritated<br>
 tone, "No, he hasn't been here at all."</p>

<p>"Well, I guess he didn't get through at the other place in
time.<br>
 I'll see what the trouble is," said the stranger, whom Franz<br>
 naturally supposed to be the electrician, lie opened the gate
and<br>
 asked the other to come in, leading him into the house. Under
a<br>
 cloudy sky the day was fading rapidly. Muller knew that it
would<br>
 not occur to the real electrician to begin any work as late as
this,<br>
 and that he was perfectly safe in the examination he wanted to
make.</p>

<p>"Well, what's the trouble here? Why did you write to our
firm?"<br>
 asked the supposed electrician.</p>

<p>"The wires must cross somewhere, or there's something wrong
with<br>
 the bells. When the housekeeper touches the button in her room
to<br>
 ring for the cook or the upstairs girl, the bell rings in Mr.
Thorne's<br>
 room. It starts ringing and it keeps up with a deuce of a
noise.<br>
 Fortunately the family are away."</p>

<p>"Well, we'll fix it all right for you. First of all I want to
look<br>
 at the button in the housekeeper's room."</p>

<p>"I'll take you up there," said Franz.</p>

<p>They walked through the wide corridor, then turned into a
shorter,<br>
 darker hall and went up a narrow winding stairway. Franz
halted<br>
 before a door in the second story. It was the last of the
three<br>
 doors in the hall." Muller took off his hat as the door
opened<br>
 and murmured a "good-evening."</p>

<p>"There's no one there; Mrs. Bernaner's out."</p>

<p>"Has she gone away, too?" asked the electrician hastily.</p>

<p>Franz did not notice that there was a slight change in the
stranger's<br>
 voice at this question, and he answered calmly as ever: "Oh,
no;<br>
 she's just driven to town. I think she went to see the doctor
who<br>
 lives quite a distance away. She hasn't been feeling at all
well.<br>
 She took a cab to-day. I told her she ought to, as she wasn't
well<br>
 enough to go by the tram. She ought to be home any moment
now."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll hurry up with the job so that I'll be out of the
way<br>
 when the lady comes," said Muller, as Franz led him to the<br>
 misbehaving bell.</p>

<p>It was in the wall immediately above a large table which
filled the<br>
 window niche so completely that there was but scant space left
for<br>
 the comfortable armchair that stood in front of it. The window
was<br>
 open and Muller leaned out, looking down at the garden
below.</p>

<p>"What a fine old garden!" he exclaimed aloud. To himself he
said:<br>
 "This is the last window in the left wing. It is the window
where<br>
 Johann Knoll saw the red light."</p>

<p>And when he turned back into the room again he found the
source of<br>
 this light right at his hand on the handsome old table at which
Mrs.<br>
 Bernauer evidently spent many of her hours. A row of books
stood<br>
 against the wall, framing the back of the table. Well-worn
volumes<br>
 of the classics among them gave proof that the one-time nurse
was a<br>
 woman of education. A sewing basket and neat piles of house
linen,<br>
 awaiting repairs, covered a large part of the table-top, and
beside<br>
 them stood a gracefully shaped lamp, covered by a shade of soft
red<br>
 silk.</p>

<p>It took Muller but a few seconds to see all this. Then he set
about<br>
 his investigation of the electric button. He unscrewed the
plate<br>
 and examined the wires meeting under it. While doing so he
cast<br>
 another glance at the table and saw a letter lying there, an
open<br>
 letter half out of its envelope. This envelope was of unusual
shape,<br>
 long and narrow, and the paper was heavy and high-glossed.</p>

<p>"Your housekeeper evidently has no secrets from the rest of
you,"<br>
 Muller remarked with a laugh, still busy at the wires, "or
she<br>
 wouldn't leave her letters lying about like that."</p>

<p>"Oh, we've all heard what's in that letter," replied Franz.
"She<br>
 read it to us when it came this morning. It's from the Madam.
She<br>
 sent messages to all of us and orders, so Mrs. Bernauer read us
the<br>
 whole letter. There's no secrets in that."</p>

<p>"The button has been pressed in too far and caught down. That
seems<br>
 to be the main trouble," said Muller, readjusting the little
knob.<br>
 "I'd like a candle here if I may have one."</p>

<p>"I'll get you a light at once," said Franz. But his
intentions,<br>
 however excellent, seemed difficult of fulfilment. It was
rapidly<br>
 growing dark, and the old butler peered about uncertainly.
"Stupid,"<br>
 he muttered. "I don't know where she keeps the matches. I
can't<br>
 find them anywhere. I'm not a smoker, so I haven't any in my
pocket."</p>

<p>"Nor I," said Muller calmly, letting his hand close
protectingly<br>
 over a new full box of them in his own pocket.</p>

<p>"I'll get you some from my own room," and Franz hurried away,
his<br>
 loose slippers clattering down the stairs. He was no sooner
well<br>
 out of the room than Muller had the letter in his hand and
was<br>
 standing close by the window to catch the fading light. But on
the<br>
 old servant's return the supposed electrician stood calmly
awaiting<br>
 the coming of the light, and the letter was back on the table
half<br>
 hidden by a piece of linen. Franz did not notice that the
envelope<br>
 was missing. And the housekeeper, whose mind was so upset by
the<br>
 events of the day, and whose thoughts were on other more
absorbing<br>
 matters, would hardly be likely to remember whether she had
returned<br>
 this quite unimportant letter to its envelope or not.</p>

<p>Franz brought a lighted candle with him, and Muller, who
really did<br>
 possess a creditable knowledge of electricity, saw that the
wires<br>
 in the room were all in good condition. As he had seen at
first,<br>
 there was really nothing the matter except with the position
of<br>
 the button. But it did not suit his purpose to enlighten Franz
on<br>
 the matter just yet.</p>

<p>"Now I'd better look at the wires in the gentleman's room,"
he<br>
 said, when he had returned plate and button to their place.</p>

<p>"Just as you say," replied Franz, taking up his candle and
leading<br>
 the way out into the hail and down the winding stair. They
crossed<br>
 the lower corridor, mounted another staircase and entered a
large,<br>
 handsomely furnished room, half studio, half library. The wall
was<br>
 covered with pictures and sketches, several easels stood piled
up<br>
 in the corner, and a broad table beside them held paint
boxes,<br>
 colour tubes, brushes, all the paraphernalia of the painter,
now<br>
 carefully ordered and covered for a term of idleness. Great<br>
 bookcases towered to the ceiling, and a huge flat top desk,
a<br>
 costly piece of furniture, was covered with books and papers.
It<br>
 was the room of a man of brains and breeding, a man of talent
and<br>
 ability, possessing, furthermore, the means to indulge his
tastes<br>
 freely. Even now, with its master absent, the handsome
apartment<br>
 bore the impress of his personality. The detective's quick<br>
 imagination called up the attractive, sympathetic figure of
the<br>
 man he had seen at the gate, as his quick eye took in the
details<br>
 of the room. All the charm of Herbert Thorne's personality,
which<br>
 the keen-sensed Muller had felt so strongly even in that
fleeting<br>
 glimpse of him, came back again here in the room which was his
own<br>
 little kingdom and the expression of his mentality.</p>

<p>"Well, what's the trouble here? Where are the wires?" asked
the<br>
 detective, after the momentary pause which had followed his
entrance<br>
 into the room. Franz led him to a spot on the wall hidden by
a<br>
 marquetry cabinet. "Here's the bell, it rings for several
minutes<br>
 before it stops."</p>

<p>The light of the candle which the butler held fell upon a
portrait<br>
 hanging above the cabinet. It was a sketch in water-colours,
the<br>
 life-sized head of a man who may have been about thirty years
old,<br>
 perhaps, but who had none of the freshness and vigour of
youth.<br>
 The scanty hair, the sunken temples, and the faded skin,
emphasised<br>
 the look of dissipation given by the lines about the sensual
mouth<br>
 and the shifty eyes.</p>

<p>"Well, say, can't your master find anything better to paint
than a<br>
 face like that?" Muller asked with a laugh.</p>

<p>"Goodness me! you mustn't say such things!" exclaimed Franz
in<br>
 alarm; "that's the Madam's brother. He's an officer, I'd have
you<br>
 know. It's true, he doesn't look like much there, but that's<br>
 because he's not in uniform. It makes such a difference."</p>

<p>"Is the lady anything like her brother?" asked the
detective<br>
 indifferently, bending to examine the wiring.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, no, not a bit; they're as different as day and
night.<br>
 He's only her half-brother anyway. She was the daughter of
the<br>
 Colonel's second wife. Our Madam is the sweetest, gentlest
lady<br>
 you can imagine, an angel of goodness. But the Lieutenant
here<br>
 has always been a care to his family, they say. I guess he's<br>
 quieted down a bit now, for his father - he's Colonel
Leining,<br>
 retired - made him get exchanged from the city to a small
garrison<br>
 town. There's nothing much to do in Marburg, I dare say -
well!<br>
 you are a merry sort, aren't you?" These last words, spoken in
a<br>
 tone of surprise, were called forth by a sudden sharp whistle
from<br>
 the detective, a whistle which went off into a few merry
bars.</p>

<p>A sudden whistle like that from Muller's lips was something
that<br>
 made the Imperial Police Force sit up and take notice, for it
meant<br>
 that things were happening, and that the happenings were likely
to<br>
 become exciting. It was a habit he could control only by the<br>
 severest effort of the will, an effort which he kept for
occasions<br>
 when it was absolutely necessary. Here, alone with the
harmless<br>
 old man, he was not so much on his guard, and the sudden
vibrating<br>
 of every nerve at the word "Marburg," found vent in the
whistle<br>
 which surprised old Franz. One young police commissioner with
a<br>
 fancy for metaphor had likened this sudden involuntary whistle
of<br>
 Muller's to the bay of the hound when he strikes the trail;
which<br>
 was about what it was.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am merry sometimes," he said with a laugh. "It's a
habit<br>
 I have. Something occurred to me just then, something I had<br>
 forgotten. Hope you don't mind."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, there's no one here now, whistle all you like."</p>

<p>But Muller's whistle was not a continuous performance, and he
had<br>
 now completely mastered the excitation of his nerves which
had<br>
 called it forth. He threw another sharp look at the picture of
the<br>
 man who lived in Marburg, and then asked: "And now where is
the<br>
 button?"</p>

<p>"By the window there, beside the desk." Franz led the way
with<br>
 his candle.</p>

<p>"Why, how funny! What are those mirrors there for?" asked
the<br>
 electrician in a tone of surprise, pointing to two small
mirrors<br>
 hanging in the window niche. They were placed at a height and
at<br>
 such a peculiar angle that no one could possibly see his
face<br>
 in them.</p>

<p>"Something the master is experimenting with, I guess. He's
always<br>
 making queer experiments; he knows a lot about scientific
things."</p>

<p>Muller shook his head as if in wonderment, and bent to
investigate<br>
 the button which was fastened into the wall beneath the window
sill.<br>
 His quick ear heard a carriage stopping in front of the house,
and<br>
 heard the closing of the front door a moment later. To
facilitate<br>
 his examination of the button, the detective had seated himself
in<br>
 the armchair which stood beside the desk. He half raised
himself<br>
 now to let the light of the candle fall more clearly on the
wiring<br>
 - then he started up altogether and threw a hasty glance at
the<br>
 mirrors above his head. A ray of light had suddenly flashed
down<br>
 upon him - a ray of red light, and it came reflected from
the<br>
 mirrors. Muller bit his lips to keep back the betraying
whistle.</p>

<p><br>
 "What's the matter?" asked the butler. "Did you drop
anything?"</p>

<p>"Yes, the wooden rim of the button," replied Muller, telling
the<br>
 truth this time. For he had held the little wooden circlet in
his<br>
 hands at the moment when the red light, reflected down from
the<br>
 mirrors, struck full upon his eyes. He had dropped it in his<br>
 surprise and excitement. Franz found the little ring in the
centre<br>
 of the room where it had rolled, and the supposed
electrician<br>
 replaced it and rose to his feet, saying: "There, I've finished
now."</p>

<p>Franz did not recognise the double meaning in the words. "Yes,
it's<br>
 all right! I've finished here now," Muller repeated to
himself.<br>
 For now he knew beyond a doubt that the red light was a signal -
and<br>
 he knew also for whom this signal was intended. It was a signal
for<br>
 Herbert Thorne! - Herbert Thorne, whom no single thought or
suspicion<br>
 of Muller's had yet connected with the murder of Leopold
Winkler.</p>

<p>The detective was very much surprised and greatly excited.
But<br>
 Franz did not notice it, and indeed a far keener observer than
the<br>
 slow-witted old butler might have failed to see the sudden
gleam<br>
 which shot up in the grey eyes behind the heavy spectacles,
might<br>
 have failed to notice the tightening of the lips beneath the
blond<br>
 moustache, or the tenseness of the slight frame under the
assumed<br>
 embonpoint. Muller's every nerve was tingling, but he had
himself<br>
 completely in hand.</p>

<p>"What do we owe you?" asked Franz.</p>

<p>"They'll send you a bill from the office. It won't amount to
much.<br>
 I must be getting on now."</p>

<p>Muller hastened out of the door and down the street to the
nearest<br>
 cab stand. There were not very many cab stands in this
vicinity,<br>
 and the detective reasoned that Mrs. Bernauer would naturally
have<br>
 taken her cab from the nearest station. He had heard her return
in<br>
 her carriage, presumably the same in which she had started
out.</p>

<p>There was but one cab at the stand. Muller walked to it and
laid<br>
 his hand on the door.</p>

<p>"Oh, Jimmy! must I go out again?" asked the driver
hoarsely.<br>
 "Can't you see the poor beast is all wet from the last ride?
We've<br>
 just come in." He pointed with his whip to the tired-looking
animal<br>
 under his blanket.</p>

<p>"Why, he does look warm. You must have been making a tour out
into<br>
 the country," said the blond gentleman in a friendly tone.</p>

<p>"No, sir, not quite so far as that. I've just taken a woman to
the<br>
 main telegraph office in the city and back again. But she was in
a<br>
 hurry and he's not a young horse, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, never mind, then; I can get another cab across the
bridge,"<br>
 replied the stout blond man, turning away and strolling off
leisurely<br>
 in the direction of the bridge. It was now quite dark, and a
few<br>
 steps further on Muller could safely turn and take the road to
his<br>
 own lodging. No one saw him go in, and in a few moments the
real<br>
 Muller, slight, smooth-shaven, sat down at his desk, looking at
the<br>
 papers that lay before him. They were three letters and an
empty<br>
 envelope.</p>

<p>He took up the last, and compared it carefully with the
envelope of<br>
 one of the letters found in Winkler's room - the unsigned
letter<br>
 postmarked Hietzing, September 24th. The two envelopes were
exactly<br>
 alike. They were of the same size and shape, made of the
same<br>
 cream-tinted, heavy, glossy paper, and the address was written
by<br>
 the same hand. This any keen observer, who need not necessarily
be<br>
 an expert, could see. The same hand which had addressed the<br>
 envelope to Mrs. Adele Bernauer on the letter which was
postmarked<br>
 "Venice," about thirty-six hours previous - this hand had, in
an<br>
 awkward and childish attempt at disguise, written Winkler's
address<br>
 on the envelope which bore the date of September 24th.</p>

<p>The writer of the harmless letter to Mrs. Bernauer, a letter
which<br>
 chatted of household topics and touched lightly on the beauties
of<br>
 Venice, was Mrs. Thorne. It was Mrs. Thorne, therefore, who,<br>
 reluctantly and in anger and distaste, had called Leopold
Winkler<br>
 to Hietzing, to his death.</p>

<p>And whose hand had fired the shot that caused his death?
The<br>
 question, at this stage in Muller's meditation, could hardly
be<br>
 called a question any more. It was all too sadly clear to him
now.<br>
 Winkler met his death at the hand of the husband, who,
discovering<br>
 the planned rendezvous, had misunderstood its motive.</p>

<p>For truly this had been no lovers' meeting. It had been a
meeting<br>
 to which the woman was driven by fear and hate; the man by greed
of<br>
 gain. This was clearly proved by the 300 guldens found in the
dead<br>
 man's pocket, money enclosed in a delicate little envelope,
sealed<br>
 hastily, and crumpled as if it had been carried in a hot and<br>
 trembling hand.</p>

<p>It was already known that Winkler never had any money except
at<br>
 certain irregular intervals, when he appeared to have come
into<br>
 possession of considerable sums. During these days he indulged
in<br>
 extravagant pleasures and spent his money with a recklessness
which<br>
 proved that he had not earned it by honest work.</p>

<p>Leopold Winkler was a blackmailer.</p>

<p>Colonel Leining, retired, the father of two such widely
different<br>
 children, was doubtless a man of stern principles, and an
army<br>
 officer as well, therefore a man with a doubly sensitive code
of<br>
 honour and a social position to maintain; and this man,
morbidly<br>
 sensitive probably, had a daughter who had inherited his<br>
 sensitiveness and his high ideals of honour, a daughter married
to<br>
 a rich husband. But he had another child, a son without any
sense<br>
 of honour at all, who, although also an officer, failed to live
in<br>
 a manner worthy his position. This son was now in Marburg,
where<br>
 there were no expensive pleasures, no all-night cafes and
gambling<br>
 dens, for a man to lose his time in, his money, and his honour
also.</p>

<p>For such must have been the case with Colonel Leining's son
before<br>
 his exile to Marburg. The old butler had hinted at the truth.
The<br>
 portrait drawn by Herbert Thorne, a picture of such
technical<br>
 excellence that it was doubtless a good likeness also, had given
an<br>
 ugly illustration to Franz's remarks. And there was something
even<br>
 more tangible to prove it: "Theo's" letter from Marburg
pleading<br>
 with Winkler for "discretion and silence," not knowing ("let
us<br>
 hope he did not know!" murmured Muller between set teeth) that
the<br>
 man who held him in his power because of some rascality, was
being<br>
 paid for his silence by the Lieutenant's sister.</p>

<p>It is easy to frighten a sensitive woman, so easy to make
her<br>
 believe the worst! And there is little such a tender-hearted
woman<br>
 will not do to save her aging father from pain and sorrow,
perhaps<br>
 even disgrace!</p>

<p>It must have been in this way that Mrs. Thorne came into the
power<br>
 of the scoundrel who paid with his life for his last attempt
at<br>
 blackmail.</p>

<p>When Muller reached this point in his chain of thought, he
closed<br>
 his eyes and covered his face with his hands, letting two
pictures<br>
 stand out clear before his mental vision.</p>

<p>He saw the little anxious group around the carriage in front
of the<br>
 Thorne mansion. He saw the pale, frail woman leaning back on
the<br>
 cushions, and the husband bending over her in tender care.
And<br>
 then he saw Johann Knoll in his cell, a man with little manhood
left<br>
 in him, a man sunk to the level of the brutes, a man who had
already<br>
 committed one crime against society, and who could never rise to
the<br>
 mental or spiritual standard of even the most mediocre of
decent<br>
 citizens.</p>

<p>If Herbert Thorne were to suffer the just punishment for his
deed<br>
 of doubly blind jealousy, then it was not only his own life, a
life<br>
 full of gracious promise, that would be ruined, but the
happiness of<br>
 his delicate, sweet-faced wife, who was doubtless still in
blessed<br>
 ignorance of what had happened. And still one other would be
dragged<br>
 down by this tragedy; a respected, upright man would bow his
white<br>
 hairs in disgrace. Thorne's father-in-law could not escape
the<br>
 scandal and his own share in the responsibility for it. And to
a<br>
 veteran officer, bred in the exaggerated social ethics of
his<br>
 profession. such a disgrace means ruin, sometimes even
voluntary<br>
 death.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, if it had only been Knoll who did it," said Muller
with<br>
 a sigh that was almost a groan.</p>

<p>Then he rose slowly and heavily, and slowly and heavily, as if
borne<br>
 down by the weight of great weariness, he reached for his hat
and<br>
 coat and left the house.</p>

<p>Whether he wished it or not, he knew it was his duty to go on
to the<br>
 bitter end on this trail he had followed up all day from the
moment<br>
 that he caught that fleeting glimpse of Mrs. Bernauer's haggard
face<br>
 at the garden gate. He was almost angry with the woman, because
she<br>
 chanced to look out of the gate at just that moment, showing him
her<br>
 face distorted with anxiety. For it was her face that had
drawn<br>
 Muller to the trail, a trail at the end of which misery awaited
those<br>
 for whom this woman had worked for years, those whom she loved
and<br>
 who treated her as one of the family.</p>

<p>Muller knew now that the one-time nurse was in league with
her<br>
 former charge; that Thorne and Adele Bernauer were in each
other's<br>
 confidence; that the man sat waiting for the signal which she
was<br>
 to give him, a signal bringing so much disgrace and sorrow in
its<br>
 train.</p>

<p>If the woman had not spied upon and betrayed her mistress,
this<br>
 terrible event, which now weighed upon her own soul, would not
have<br>
 happened.</p>

<p>"A faithful servant, indeed," said Muller, with a harsh
laugh.</p>

<p>Then maturer consideration came and forced him to acknowledge
that<br>
 it was indeed devotion that had swayed Adele Bernauer, devotion
to<br>
 her master more than to her mistress. This was hardly to be<br>
 wondered at. But she had not thought what might come from
her<br>
 revelations, what had come of them. For now her pet, the baby
who<br>
 had once lain in her arms, the handsome, gifted man whom she
adored<br>
 with more than the love of many a mother for the child of her
own<br>
 blood, was under the shadow of hideous disgrace and doom, was
the<br>
 just prey of the law for open trial and condemnation as a
murderer.</p>

<p>Muller sighed deeply once more and then came one of those
moments<br>
 which he had spoken of to the unhappy woman that very day. He
felt<br>
 like cursing the fatal gift that was his, the gift to see what
was<br>
 hidden from others, this something within him that forced
him<br>
 relentlessly onward until he had uncovered the truth, and
brought<br>
 misery to many.</p>

<p>Muller need not do anything, he need simply do nothing. Not a
soul<br>
 besides himself suspected the dwellers in the Thorne mansion of
any<br>
 connection with the murder. If he were silent, nothing could
be<br>
 proven against Knoll after all, except the robbery which he
himself<br>
 had confessed. Then the memory of the terror in the tramp's
little<br>
 reddened eyes came back to the detective's mind.</p>

<p>"A human soul after all, and a soul trembling in the shadow of
a<br>
 great fear. And even he's a better man than the blackmailer
who<br>
 was killed. A miscarriage of justice will often make a
criminal<br>
 of a poor fellow whose worst fault is idleness." Muller's
face<br>
 darkened as the things of the past, shut down in the depths of
his<br>
 own soul, rose up again. "No; that's why I took up this
work.<br>
 Justice must be done - but it's bitter hard sometimes. I
could<br>
 almost wish now that I hadn't seen that face at the gate."</p>

<p><br>
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>MULLER RETURNS TO THE THORNE MANSION</h3>

<p><br>
 It was striking eight as Muller came out of a cafe in the heart
of<br>
 the city. He had been in there but a few moments, for his
purpose<br>
 was merely to look through the Army lists of the current year.
The<br>
 result of his search proved the correctness of his
conclusions.</p>

<p>There was a Lieutenant Theobald Leining in the single
infantry<br>
 regiment stationed at Marburg.</p>

<p>Muller took a cab and drove to the main telegraph office. He
asked<br>
 for the original of the telegram which had been sent that
afternoon<br>
 to the address; "Herbert Thorne, Hotel Danieli, Venice."
This<br>
 closed the circle of the chain.</p>

<p><br>
 The detective re-entered his waiting cab and drove back to
Hietzing.<br>
 He told the driver to halt at the corner of the street on
which<br>
 fronted the Thorne mansion and to wait for him there. He
himself<br>
 walked slowly down the quiet Street and rang the bell at the
iron<br>
 gate.</p>

<p>"You come to this house again?" asked Franz, starting back
in<br>
 alarm when he saw who it was that had called him to the
door.</p>

<p>"Yes, my good friend; I want to get into this house again. But
not<br>
 on false pretenses this time. And before you let me in you can
go<br>
 upstairs and ask Mrs. Bernauer if she will receive me in her
own<br>
 room - in her own room, mind. But make haste; I am in a
hurry."<br>
 The detective's tone was calm and he strolled slowly up and down
in<br>
 front of the gate when he had finished speaking.</p>

<p>The old butler hesitated a moment, then walked into the
house.<br>
 When he returned, rather more quickly, he looked alarmed and
his<br>
 tone was very humble as he asked Muller to follow him.</p>

<p>When the detective entered Mrs. Bernauer's room the
housekeeper<br>
 rose slowly from the large armchair in front of her table. She
was<br>
 very pale and her eyes were full of terror. She made no move
to<br>
 speak, so Muller began the conversation. He put down his
hat,<br>
 brought up a chair and placed it near the window at which
the<br>
 housekeeper had been sitting. Then he sat down and motioned
to<br>
 her to do the same.</p>

<p>"You are a faithful servant, all too faithful," he began.
"But<br>
 you are faithful only to your master. You have no devotion
for<br>
 his wife."</p>

<p>"You are mistaken," replied the woman in a low tone.</p>

<p>"Perhaps, but I do not think so. One does not betray the
people<br>
 to whom one is devoted."</p>

<p>Mrs. Bernauer looked up in surprise. "What - what do you
know?"<br>
 she stammered.</p>

<p>Muller did not answer the question directly, but continued:
"Mrs.<br>
 Thorne had a meeting recently with a strange man. It was not
their<br>
 first meeting, and somehow you discovered it. But before this
last<br>
 meeting occurred you spoke to the lady's husband about it, and
it<br>
 was arranged between you that you should give him a signal
which<br>
 would mean to him, 'Your wife is going to the meeting.' Mrs.
Thorne<br>
 did go to the meeting. This happened on Monday evening at
about<br>
 quarter past nine. Some one, who was in the neighbourhood by<br>
 chance, saw a woman's figure hurrying through the garden, down
to<br>
 the other street, and a moment after this, the light of this
lamp<br>
 in your window was seen to go out. A hand had turned down
the<br>
 wick - it was your hand.</p>

<p>"This was the signal to Mr. Thorne. The mirrors over his
desk<br>
 reflected in his eyes the light he could not otherwise have
seen<br>
 as he sat by his own window. The signal, therefore, told him
that<br>
 the time had come to act. This same chance watcher, who had
seen<br>
 the woman going through the garden, had seen the lamp go out,
and<br>
 now saw a man's figure hurrying down the path the woman had
taken.<br>
 The man as well as the woman came from this house and went in
the<br>
 direction of the lower end of the garden.</p>

<p>"A little while later a shot was heard, and the next morning
Leopold<br>
 Winkler was found with a bullet in his back. The crime was<br>
 generally taken to be a murder for the sake of robbery. But you
and<br>
 I, and Mr. Herbert Thorne, know very well that it was not.</p>

<p>"You know this since Wednesday noon. Then it was that the
idea<br>
 suddenly came to you, falling like a heavy weight on your soul,
the<br>
 idea that Winkler might not have been killed for the sake of
robbery,<br>
 but because of the hatred that some one bore him. Then it was
that<br>
 you lost your appetite suddenly, that you drove into the city
with<br>
 the excuse of errands to do, in order to read the papers
without<br>
 being seen by any one who knew you. When you came home you
searched<br>
 everywhere in your master's room: you made an excuse for this
search,<br>
 but what you wanted to find out was whether he had left
anything<br>
 that could betray him. Your fright had already confused your
mind.<br>
 You were searching probably for the weapon from which he had
fired<br>
 the bullet. You did not realise that he would naturally have
taken<br>
 it with him and thrown it somewhere into a ravine or river
beside<br>
 the railway track between here and Venice. How could you think
for<br>
 a moment that he would leave it behind him, here in his room,
or<br>
 dropped in the garden? But this was doubtless due to the
confusion<br>
 owing to your sudden alarm and anxiety - a confusion which
prevented<br>
 you from realising the danger of the two peculiarly hung mirrors
in<br>
 Mr. Thorne's room. These should have been taken away at once.
This<br>
 morning my sudden appearance at the garden gate prevented you
from<br>
 making an examination of the place of the murder. Your swoon,
after<br>
 I had spoken to you in the butler's room, showed me that you
were<br>
 carrying a burden too heavy for your strength. Finally, this<br>
 afternoon, you drove to the main telegraph office in the city,
as<br>
 you thought that it would be safer to telegraph Mr. Thorne
from<br>
 there. Your telegram was very cleverly written. But you might
have<br>
 spared the last sentence, the request that Mr. Thorne should get
the<br>
 Viennese papers of these last days. Believe me, he has already
read<br>
 these papers. Who could be more interested in what they have to
tell<br>
 than he?"</p>

<p>The housekeeper had sat as if frozen to stone during Muller's
long<br>
 speech. Her face was ashen and her eyes wild with horror. When
the<br>
 detective ceased speaking, there was dead silence in the room
for<br>
 some time. Finally Muller asked: "Is this what happened?" His
voice<br>
 was cutting and the glance of his eyes keen and sharp.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bernauer trembled. Her head sank on her breast. Muller
waited<br>
 a moment more and then he said quietly: "Then it is true."</p>

<p>"Yes, it is true," came the answer in a low hoarse tone.</p>

<p>Again there was silence for an appreciable interval.</p>

<p>"If you had been faithful to your mistress as well, if you had
not<br>
 spied upon her and betrayed her to her husband, all this might
not<br>
 have happened," continued the detective pitilessly, adding with
a<br>
 bitter smile: "And it was not even a case of sinful love.
Your<br>
 mistress had no such relations with this Winkler as you - I
say<br>
 this to excuse you - seemed to believe."</p>

<p>Adele Bernauer sprang up. "I do not need this excuse," she
cried,<br>
 trembling in excitement. "I do not need any excuse. What I
have<br>
 done I did after due consideration and in the realisation that
it<br>
 was absolutely necessary to do it. Never for one moment did
I<br>
 believe that my mistress was untrue to her husband. Never for
one<br>
 moment could I believe such an evil thing of her, for I knew her
to<br>
 be an angel of goodness. A woman who is deceiving her husband
is<br>
 not as unhappy as this poor lady has been for months. A woman
does<br>
 not write to a successful lover with so much sorrow, with so
many<br>
 tears. I had long suspected these meetings before I
discovered<br>
 them, but I knew that these meetings had nothing whatever to
do<br>
 with love. Because I knew this, and only because I knew it, did
I<br>
 tell my master about them. I wanted him to protect his wife,
to<br>
 free her from the wretch who had obtained some power over her,
I<br>
 knew not how."</p>

<p>"Ah! then that was it?" exclaimed Muller, and his eyes
softened<br>
 as he looked at the sobbing woman who had sunk back into her
chair.<br>
 He laid his hand on her cold fingers and continued gently:
"Then<br>
 you have really done right, you have done only what was your
duty.<br>
 I pity you deeply that you - "</p>

<p>"That I have brought suspicion upon my master by my own
foolishness?"<br>
 she finished the sentence with a pitifully sad smile. "If I
could<br>
 have controlled myself, could have kept calm, nobody would have
had<br>
 a thought or a suspicion that he - my pet, my darling - that it
was<br>
 he who was forced, through some terrible circumstance of which I
do<br>
 not know, to free his wife, in this manner, from the wretch
who<br>
 persecuted her."</p>

<p>Mrs. Bernauer wrung her hands and gazed with despairing eyes
at the<br>
 man who sat before her, himself deeply moved.</p>

<p>Again there was a long silence. Muller could not find a word
to<br>
 comfort the weeping woman. There was no longer anger in his
heart,<br>
 nothing but the deepest pity. He took out his handkerchief
and<br>
 wiped away the drops that were dimming his own eyes.</p>

<p>"You know that I will have to go to Venice?" he asked.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bernauer sprang up. "Officially?" she gasped, pale to
her<br>
 lips.</p>

<p>He nodded. "Yes, officially of course. I must make a report
at<br>
 once to headquarters about what I have learned. You can
imagine<br>
 yourself what the next steps will be."</p>

<p>Her deep sigh showed him that she knew as well as he. In the
same<br>
 second, however, a thought shot through her brain, changing
her<br>
 whole king. Her pale face glowed, her dulled eyes shot fire,
and<br>
 the fingers with which she held Muller's hand tightly clasped,
were<br>
 suddenly feverishly hot.</p>

<p>"And you - you are still the only person who knows the truth?"
she<br>
 gasped in his ear.</p>

<p>The detective nodded. "And you thought you might silence me?"
he<br>
 asked calmly. "That will not be easy - for you can imagine that
I<br>
 did not come unarmed."</p>

<p>Adele Bernauer smiled sadly. "I would take even this way to
save<br>
 Herbert Thorne from disgrace, if I thought that it could be<br>
 successful, and if I had not thought of a milder way to silence
a<br>
 man who cannot be a millionaire. I have served in this house
for<br>
 thirty-two years, I have been treated with such generosity that
I<br>
 have been able to save almost every cent of my wages for my
old<br>
 age. With the interest that has rolled up, my little fortune
must<br>
 amount to nearly eight thousand gulden. I will gladly give it
to<br>
 you, if you will but keep silence, if you will not tell what
you<br>
 have discovered." She spoke gaspingly and sank down on her
knees<br>
 before she had finished.</p>

<p>"And Mr. Thorne also - " she continued hastily, as she saw no
sign<br>
 of interest in Muller's calm face. Then her voice failed
her.</p>

<p>The detective looked down kindly on her grey hairs and
answered:<br>
 "No, no, my good woman; that won't do. One cannot conceal
one<br>
 crime by committing another. I myself would naturally not
listen<br>
 to your suggestion for a moment, but I am also convinced that
Mr.<br>
 Thorne, to whom you are so devoted, and who, I acknowledge,
pleased<br>
 me the very first sight I had of him - I am convinced that he
would<br>
 not agree for a moment to any such solution of the problem."</p>

<p>"Then I can only hope that you will not find him in
Venice,"<br>
 replied Mrs. Bernauer, with utter despair in her voice and
eyes.</p>

<p>"I am not at all certain that I will find him in Venice when
I<br>
 leave here to-morrow morning," said Muller calmly.</p>

<p>"Oh! then you don't want to find him! Oh God! how good,
how<br>
 inexpressibly good you are," stammered the woman, seizing at
some<br>
 vague hope in her distraught heart.</p>

<p>"No, you are mistaken again, Mrs. Bernauer. I will find Mr.
Thorne<br>
 wherever he may be. But I may arrive in Venice too late to
meet<br>
 him there. He may already be on his way home."</p>

<p>"On his way home?" cried the housekeeper in terror,
staggering<br>
 where she stood.</p>

<p>Muller led her gently to a chair. "Sit down here and listen to
me<br>
 calmly. This is what I mean. If Mr. Thorne has seen in the
papers<br>
 that a man has been arrested and accused of the murder of
Leopold<br>
 Winkler, then he will take the next train back and give himself
up<br>
 to the authorities. That he makes no such move as long as he
thinks<br>
 there is no suspicion on any one else, no possibility that any
one<br>
 else could suffer the consequences of his deed - is quite<br>
 comprehensible - it is only natural and human."</p>

<p>Adele Bernauer sighed deeply again and heavy tears ran down
her<br>
 cheeks, in strange contrast to the ghost of a smile that
parted<br>
 her lips and shone in her dimmed eyes.</p>

<p>"You know him better than I do," she murmured almost
inaudibly,<br>
 "you know him better than I do, and I have known him for so
long."</p>

<p>A moment later Muller had parted from the housekeeper with a
warm,<br>
 sincere pressure of the hand.</p>

<p>"Lieutenant Theobald Leining was here on a visit to his sister
last<br>
 March, wasn't he?" the detective asked as Franz led him out of
the<br>
 gate.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; the Lieutenant was here just about that time,"
answered<br>
 the old man.</p>

<p>And he left here on the 16th of March?"</p>

<p>"On the 16th? Why, it may have been - yes, it was the 16th -
that<br>
 is our lady's birthday. He went away that day." Franz bowed
a<br>
 farewell to this stranger who began to appear uncanny in his
eyes,<br>
 and shutting the gate carefully he returned to the house.</p>

<p>"What does the man want anyway?" he murmured to himself,
shivering<br>
 involuntarily. Without knowing why he turned his steps towards
Mrs.<br>
 Bernauer s room. He opened the door hesitatingly as if afraid
of<br>
 what he might see there. He would not have been at all surprised
if<br>
 he had found the housekeeper fainting on the floor as
before.</p>

<p>But she was not fainting this time. She was very much alive,
for,<br>
 to Franz's great astonishment, she was busied at the packing of
a<br>
 valise.</p>

<p>"Are you going away too?" asked Franz. Mrs. Bernauer answered
in<br>
 a voice that was dull with weariness: "Yes, Franz, I am going
away.<br>
 Will you please look up the time-tables of the Southern
railroad<br>
 and let me know when the morning express leaves? And please
order<br>
 a cab in time for it. I will depend upon you to look after
the<br>
 house in my absence. You can imagine that it must be
something<br>
 very important that takes me to Venice."</p>

<p>"To Venice? Why, what are you going to Venice for?"</p>

<p>"Never mind about that, Franz, but help me to pray that I may
get<br>
 there in time."</p>

<p>She almost pushed the old man out of the door with these
last<br>
 words and shut and locked it behind him.</p>

<p>She wanted to be alone with this hideous fear that was
clutching<br>
 at her heart. For it was not to Franz that she could tell
the<br>
 thoughts that came to her lips now as she sank down, wringing
her<br>
 hands, before a picture of the Madonna: "Oh Holy Virgin,
Mother<br>
 of our Lord, plead for me! let me be with my dear mistress
when<br>
 the terrible time comes and they take her husband away from
her,<br>
 or, if preferring death to disgrace, he ends his life by his
own<br>
 hand!"</p>

<h2><br>
 CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>IN THE POLICE COURT</h3>

<p><br>
 Commissioner Von Riedau sat at his desk late that evening,<br>
 finishing up some important papers. The quiet of an
undisturbed<br>
 night watch had settled down on the busy police station. An<br>
 occasional low murmur of whispering voices floated up from
the<br>
 guardroom below, but otherwise the stillness was broken only
by<br>
 the scratching of the commissioner's pen and the rustle of
the<br>
 paper as he turned the leaves. It was a silence so complete
that<br>
 a light step on the stair outside and the gentle turning of
the<br>
 doorknob was heard distinctly and the commissioner looked up<br>
 with almost a start to see who was coming to his room so
late.<br>
 Joseph Muller stood in the open door, awaiting his chief's
official<br>
 recognition.</p>

<p><br>
 "Oh ! it's you, Muller. So late? Come in. Anything new?"
asked<br>
 the commissioner. "Have you succeeded in drawing a confession
from<br>
 that stubborn tramp yet? You've been interviewing him, I take
it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I had a long talk with Johann Knoll to-day."</p>

<p>"Well, that ought to help matters along. Has he confessed?
What<br>
 could you get out of him?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, or almost nothing more than he told us here in the
station,<br>
 sir.</p>

<p>"The man's incredibly stubborn," said the commissioner. "If
he<br>
 could only be made to understand that a free confession would
benefit<br>
 him more than any one else! Well, don't look so down-cast about
it,<br>
 Muller. This thing is going to take longer than we thought at
first<br>
 for such a simple affair. But it's only a question of time until
the<br>
 man comes to his senses. You'll get him to talk soon. You
always<br>
 do. And even if you should fail here, this matter is not so
very<br>
 important, when we think of all the other things you have
done."<br>
 Muller, standing front of the desk, shook his head sadly.</p>

<p>"But I haven't failed here, sir. More's the pity, I had
almost<br>
 said."</p>

<p>"What!" The commissioner looked up in surprise. "I thought
you<br>
 just said that you couldn't get anything more out of the
accused."</p>

<p>"Knoll has told us all he knows, sir. He did not murder
Leopold<br>
 Winkler."</p>

<p>"Hmph!" The commissioner's exclamation had a touch of acidity
in<br>
 it. "Then, if he didn't murder him, who did?"</p>

<p>"Herbert Thorne, painter, living in the Thorne mansion in B.
Street,<br>
 Hietzing, now in Venice, Hotel Danieli. I ask for a warrant
for<br>
 his arrest, sir, and orders to start for Venice on the early
morning<br>
 express to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Muller! ... what the deuce does all this mean?" The
commissioner<br>
 sprang up, his face flushing deeply as he leaned over the
desk<br>
 staring at the sad quiet face of the little man opposite.
"What<br>
 are you talking about? What does all this mean?"</p>

<p>"It means, sir, that we now know who committed the murder
in<br>
 Hietzing. Johann Knoll is innocent of anything more than the
theft<br>
 confessed by himself. He took the purse and watch from the<br>
 senseless form of the just murdered man. The body was warm
and<br>
 still supple and the tramp supposed the victim to be merely<br>
 intoxicated. His story was in every respect true, sir."</p>

<p>The commissioner flushed still deeper. "And who do you say
murdered<br>
 this man?"</p>

<p>"Herbert Thorne, sir.</p>

<p>"But Thome! I know of him ... have even a slight personal<br>
 acquaintance with him. Thorne is a rich man, of excellent
family.<br>
 Why should he murder and rob an obscure clerk like this
Winkler?"</p>

<p>"He did not rob him sir, Knoll did that."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. But why should Thorne commit murder on this man
who<br>
 scarcely touched his life at any point ... It's incredible!<br>
 Muller! Muller! are you sure you are not letting your
imagination<br>
 run away with you again? It is a serious thing to make such
an<br>
 accusation against any man, much less against a man in
Thorne's<br>
 position. Are you sure of what you are saying?" The
commissioner's<br>
 excitement rendered him almost inarticulate. The shock of
the<br>
 surprise occasioned by the detective's words produced a feeling
of<br>
 irritation ... a phenomenon not unusual in the minds of worthy
but<br>
 pedantic men of affairs when confronted by a startling new
thought.</p>

<p>"I am quite sure of what I am saying, sir. I have just heard
the<br>
 confession of one who might be called an accomplice of the
murderer."</p>

<p>"It is incredible ... incredible! An accomplice you say? ...
who<br>
 is this accomplice? Might it not be some one who has a
grudge<br>
 against Thorne - some one who is trying to purposely mislead you
?"</p>

<p>"I am not so easily deceived or misled, sir. Every evidence
points<br>
 to Thorne, and the confession I have just heard was made by a
woman<br>
 who loves him, who has loved and cared for him from his
babyhood.<br>
 There is not the slightest doubt of it, sir."</p>

<p>Muller moved a step nearer the desk, gazing firmly in the eyes
of<br>
 the excited commissioner. The sadness on the detective's face
had<br>
 given way to a gleam of pride that flushed his sallow cheek
and<br>
 brightened his grey eyes. It was one of those rare moments
when<br>
 Muller allowed himself a feeling of triumph in his own power,
in<br>
 spite of official subordination and years of habit. His
slight<br>
 frame seemed to grow taller and broader as he faced the Chief
with<br>
 an air of quiet determination that made him at once master of
the<br>
 situation. His voice was as low as ever but it took on a
keen<br>
 incisive note that compelled attention, as he continued:
"Herbert<br>
 Thorne is the murderer of Leopold Winkler. Now that he knows
an<br>
 innocent man is under accusation for his deed it is only a
question<br>
 of time before he will come himself to confess. He will
doubtless<br>
 make this confession to me, if I go to Venice to see him, and
to<br>
 bring him back to trial."</p>

<p>The commissioner could doubt no longer. Pedantic though he
was,<br>
 Commissioner von Riedau possessed sufficient insight to know
the<br>
 truth when it was presented to him with such conviction, and
also<br>
 sufficient insight to have recognised the gifts of the man
before<br>
 him. "But why ... why?" he murmured, sinking back into his
chair,<br>
 and shaking his<br>
 head in bewilderment.</p>

<p>"Winkler was a miserable scoundrel, sir, a blackmailer. Thorne
did<br>
 only what any decent man would have felt like doing in his
place.<br>
 But justice must be done."</p>

<p>Muller's elation vanished and a deep sigh welled up from his
heart.<br>
 The commissioner nodded slowly, and glanced across the desk
almost<br>
 timidly. This case had appeared to be so simple, and suddenly
the<br>
 hidden deeps of a dark mystery had opened before him, deeps
already<br>
 sounded by the little man here who had gone so quietly about
his<br>
 work while the official police, represented in this case by<br>
 Commissioner von Riedau himself, had sat calmly waiting for
an<br>
 innocent man to confess to a crime he had not committed! It
was<br>
 humiliating. The commissioner flushed again and his eyes sank
to<br>
 the floor.</p>

<p>"Tell me what you know, Muller," he said finally.</p>

<p>Muller told the story of his experiences in the Thorne
mansion,<br>
 told of the slight clues which led him to take an interest in
the<br>
 house and its inmates, until finally the truth began to glimmer
up<br>
 out of the depths. The commissioner listened with eager
interest.<br>
 "Then you believed this elaborate yarn told by the tramp?"
he<br>
 interrupted once, at the beginning of the narrative.</p>

<p>"Why, yes, sir, just because it was so elaborate. A man like
Knoll<br>
 would not have had the mind to invent such a story. It must
have<br>
 been true, on the face of it."</p>

<p>The commissioner's eyes sank again, and he did not speak until
the<br>
 detective had reached the end of his story. Then he opened a
drawer<br>
 in his desk and took out a bundle of official blank-forms.</p>

<p>"It is wonderful! Wonderful! Muller, this case will go on
record<br>
 as one of your finest achievements - and we thought it was so
simple</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed, sir, chance favoured me at every turn," replied
Muller<br>
 modestly.</p>

<p>"There is no such thing as chance," said the commissioner.
"We<br>
 might as well be honest with ourselves. Any one might have
seen,<br>
 doubtless did see, all the things you saw, but no one else had
the<br>
 insight to recognise their value, nor the skill to follow them
up<br>
 to such a conclusion. But it's a sad case, a sad case. I
never<br>
 wrote a warrant with a heavier heart. Thorne is a
true-hearted<br>
 gentleman, while the scoundrel he killed..."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I feel that way about it myself. I can confess now
that<br>
 there was one moment when I was ready to-well, just to say
nothing.</p>

<p>"And let us blunder on in our official stupidity and
blindness?"<br>
 interrupted the commissioner, a faint smile breaking the gravity
of<br>
 his face. "We certainly gave you every opportunity."</p>

<p>"But there's an innocent man accused - suffering fear of
death<br>
 - justice must be done. But, sir," Muller took the warrant
the<br>
 commissioner handed across the table to him. "May I not make
it<br>
 as easy as I can for Mr. Thorne - I mean, bring him here with
as<br>
 little publicity as possible? His wife is with him in
Venice."</p>

<p>"Poor little woman, it's terrible! Do whatever you think
best,<br>
 Muller. You're a queer mixture. Here you've hounded this man
down,<br>
 followed hot on his trail when not a soul but yourself
connected<br>
 him in any way with the murder. And now you're sorry for him!
A<br>
 soft heart like yours is a dangerous possession for a police<br>
 detective, Muller. It's no aid to our business."</p>

<p>"No, sir, I know that."</p>

<p>"Well take care it doesn't run away with you this time. Don't
let<br>
 Herbert Thorne escape, however much pity you may feel for
him."</p>

<p>"I doubt if he'll want to sir, as long as another is in prison
for<br>
 his crime.</p>

<p>"But he may make his confession and then try to escape the
disgrace."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I've thought of that. That's why I want to go to
Venice<br>
 myself. And then, there's the poor young wife, he must think of
her<br>
 when the desire comes to end his own life..."</p>

<p>"Yes! Yes! This terrible thing has shaken us both up more than
a<br>
 little. I feel exhausted. You look tired yourself, Muller. Go
home<br>
 now, and get some rest for your early start. Good-night."</p>

<p>"Good-night, sir."</p>

<h2><br>
 CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>ON THE LIDO</h3>

<p><br>
 A Wonderfully beautiful night lay over the fair old city of
Venice<br>
 when the Northern Express thundered over the long bridge to
the<br>
 railway station. A passenger who was alone in a second-class<br>
 compartment stood up to collect his few belongings. Suddenly
he<br>
 looked up as he heard a voice, a voice which he had learned to
know<br>
 only very recently, calling to him from the door of the
compartment.</p>

<p>"Why! you were in the train too? You have come to Venice?"<br>
 exclaimed Joseph Muller in astonishment as he saw Mrs.
Bernauer<br>
 standing there before him.</p>

<p><br>
 "Yes, I have come to Venice too. I must be with my dear lady -
when<br>
 - when Herbert - " She had begun quite calmly, but she did
not<br>
 finish her sentence, for loud sobs drowned the words.</p>

<p>"You were in the next compartment? Why didn't you come in
here<br>
 with me? It would have made this journey shorter for both of
us."</p>

<p>"I had to be alone," said the pale woman and then she added:
"I<br>
 only came to you now to ask you where I must go."</p>

<p>"I think we two had better go to the Hotel Bauer. Let me
arrange<br>
 things for you. Mrs. Thorne must not see you until she has
been<br>
 prepared for your coming. I will arrange that with her
husband."</p>

<p>The two took each other's hands. They had won respect and
sympathy<br>
 for each other, this quiet man who went so relentlessly and yet
so<br>
 pityingly about his duty in the interest of justice - and the
devoted<br>
 woman whose faithfulness had brought about such a tragedy.</p>

<p>The train had now entered the railway station. Muller and
Mrs.<br>
 Bernauer stood a few minutes later on the banks of the Grand
Canal<br>
 and entered, one of the many gondolas waiting there. The
moon<br>
 glanced back from the surface of the water broken into ripples
under<br>
 the oars of the gondoliers; it shone with a magic charm on the
old<br>
 palaces that stood knee-deep in the lagoons, and threw heavy
shadows<br>
 over the narrow water-roads on which the little dark boats
glided<br>
 silently forward. In most of the gondolas coming from the
station<br>
 excited voices and exclamations of delight broke the calm of
the<br>
 moonlit evening as the tourists rejoiced in the beauty that
is<br>
 Venice.</p>

<p>But in the gondola in which Muller and Mrs. Bernauer sat there
was<br>
 deep silence, silence broken only by a sobbing sigh that now
and<br>
 then burst from the heart of the haggard woman. There were
few<br>
 travellers entering Venice on one of its world-famous moonlit
nights<br>
 who were so sad at heart as were these two.</p>

<p>And there were few travellers in Venice as heavy hearted as
was the<br>
 man who next morning took one of the earliest boats out to the
Lido.</p>

<p>Muller and Mrs. Bernauer were on the same boat watching him
from a<br>
 hidden corner. The woman's sad eyes gazed yearningly at the
haggard<br>
 face of the tall man who stood looking over the railing of the
little<br>
 steamer. Her own tears came as she saw the gloom in the once
shining<br>
 grey eyes she loved so well.</p>

<p>Muller stood beside Mrs. Bernauer. His eyes too, keen and
quick,<br>
 followed Herbert Thorne as he stood by the rail or paced
restlessly<br>
 up and down; his face too showed pity and concern. He also saw
that<br>
 Thorne held in his hand a bundle of newspapers which were
still<br>
 enclosed in their mailing wrappers. The papers were pressed in
a<br>
 convulsive grip of the artist's long slender fingers.</p>

<p>Muller knew then that Thorne had not yet learned of the arrest
of<br>
 Johann Knoll. At the very earliest, Thursday's papers, which
brought<br>
 the news, could not reach him before Friday morning. But
these<br>
 newspapers (Muller saw that they were German papers) were still
in<br>
 their wrappings. They were probably Viennese papers for which he
had<br>
 telegraphed and which had just arrived. His anxiety had not
allowed<br>
 him to read them in the presence of his wife. He had sought
the<br>
 solitude of early morning on the Lido, that he might learn,<br>
 unobserved, what terrors fate had in store for him.</p>

<p>It was doubtless Mrs. Bernauer's telegram which caused his
present<br>
 anxiety, a telegram which had reached him only the night
before<br>
 when he returned with his wife from an excursion to Torcello.
It<br>
 had caused him a sleepless night, for it had brought the
realisation<br>
 that his faithful nurse suspected the truth about the murder in
the<br>
 quiet lane. The telegram had read as follows: "Have drawn money
and<br>
 send it at once. Further journey probably necessary, visitor
in<br>
 house to-day. Connected with occurrence in -Street. Please
read<br>
 Viennese papers. News and orders for me please send to address
A.B.<br>
 General Postoffice."</p>

<p>This telegram told Herbert Thorne the truth. And the papers
which<br>
 arrived this morning were to tell him more - what he did not
yet<br>
 know. But his heart was drawn with terrors which threw lines in
his<br>
 face and made him look ten years older than on that Tuesday
morning<br>
 when the detective saw him setting out on his journey with his
wife.</p>

<p>When the boat landed at the Lido, Thorne walked off down the
road<br>
 which led to the ocean side. Muller and Mrs. Bernauer entered
the<br>
 waiting tramway that took them in the same direction. They<br>
 dismounted in front of the bathing establishment, stepped behind
a<br>
 group of bushes and waited there for Thorne. In about ten
minutes<br>
 they saw his tall figure passing on the other side of the road.
He<br>
 was walking down to the beach, holding the still unopened papers
in<br>
 his hand.</p>

<p>A narrow strip of park runs along parallel to the beach in
the<br>
 direction towards Mala Mocco. Muller and Mrs Bernauer walked
along<br>
 through this park on the path which was nearest the water.
The<br>
 detective watched the rapidly moving figure ahead of them, while
the<br>
 woman's tear-dimmed eyes veiled everything else to her but the
path<br>
 along which her weary feet hastened. Thorne halted about half
way<br>
 between the bathing establishment and the customs barracks,
looked<br>
 around to see if he were alone and threw himself down on the
sand.</p>

<p>He had chosen a good place. To the right and to the left were
high<br>
 sand dunes, before him was the broad surface of the ocean, and
at<br>
 his back was rising ground, bare sand with here and there a
scraggly<br>
 bush or a group of high thistles. Herbert Thorne believed
himself<br>
 to be alone here ... as far as a man can be alone over whom
hangs<br>
 the shadow of a crime. He groaned aloud and hid his pale face
in<br>
 his hands.</p>

<p>In his own distress he did not hear the deep sigh - which,
just<br>
 above him on the edge of the knoll, broke from the breast of a
woman<br>
 who was suffering scarcely less than he; he did not know that
two<br>
 pair of sad eyes looked down upon him. And now into the eyes of
the<br>
 watching woman there shot a gleam of terror. For Herbert Thorne
had<br>
 taken a revolver from his pocket and laid it quietly beside
him.<br>
 Then he took out a notebook and a pencil and placed them beside
the<br>
 weapon. Then slowly, reluctantly, he opened one of the
papers.</p>

<p>A light breeze from the shining sea before him carried off
the<br>
 wrapping. The paper which he opened shook in his trembling
hands,<br>
 as his eyes sought the reports of the murder. He gave a
sudden<br>
 start and a tremor ran through his frame. He had come to the
spot<br>
 which told of the arrest of another man, who was under shadow
of<br>
 punishment for the crime which he himself had committed. When
he<br>
 had read this report through, he turned to the other papers. He
was<br>
 quite calm now, outwardly calm at least.</p>

<p>When he had finished reading the papers he laid them in a
heap<br>
 beside him and reached out for his notebook. As he opened it
the<br>
 two watchers saw that between its first pages there was a sealed
and<br>
 addressed letter. Two other envelopes were contained in the<br>
 notebook, envelopes which were also addressed although still
open.<br>
 Muller's sharp eyes could read the addresses as Thorne took them
up<br>
 in turn, looking long at each of them. One envelope was
addressed<br>
 in Italian to the Chief of Police of Venice, the other to the
Chief<br>
 of Police in Vienna.</p>

<p>The two watchers leaned forward, scarcely three yards above
the man<br>
 in whom they were interested. Thorne tore out two leaves of
his<br>
 notebook and wrote several lines on each of them. One note,
he<br>
 placed in the envelope addressed to the Viennese police and
sealed<br>
 it carefully. Then he put the sealed letter with the second note
in<br>
 the other envelope, the one addressed to the Italian police. He
put<br>
 all the letters back in his notebook, holding it together with
a<br>
 rubber strap, and replaced it in his pocket.</p>

<p>Then he stretched out his hand toward the revolver.</p>

<p>The sand came rattling down upon him, the thistles bent
over<br>
 creakingly and two figures appeared beside him.</p>

<p>"There's time enough for that yet, Mr. Thorne," said the man
at whom<br>
 the painter gazed up in bewilderment. And then this man took
the<br>
 revolver quietly from his hand and hid it in his own pocket.</p>

<p>Thorne pressed his teeth down on his lips until the blood
came. He<br>
 could not speak; he looked first at the stranger who had
mastered<br>
 him so completely, and then, in dazed astonishment, at the woman
who<br>
 had sunk down beside him in the sand, clasping his hand in both
of<br>
 hers.</p>

<p>"Adele! Adele! 'Why are you here?" he stammered finally.</p>

<p>"I want to be with you - in this hour," she answered, looking
at<br>
 him with eyes of worship. "I want to be with my dear lady -
to<br>
 comfort her - to protect her when - when - "</p>

<p>"When they arrest me?" Thorne finished the sentence himself.
Then<br>
 turning to Muller he continued: "And that is why you are
here?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Thorne. I have a warrant for your arrest in my
pocket.<br>
 But I think it will be unnecessary to make use of it in the<br>
 customary official way through the authorities here. I see
that<br>
 you have written to both police stations - confessing your
deed.<br>
 This will amount to a voluntary giving up of yourself to the<br>
 authorities, therefore all that is necessary is that I return
with<br>
 you in the same train which takes you to Vienna. But I must
ask<br>
 you for those two letters, for until you yourself give them to
the<br>
 police authorities in my presence, it is my duty to keep
them."</p>

<p>Muller had seldom found his official duty as difficult as it
was<br>
 now. His words came haltingly and great drops stood out on
his<br>
 forehead.</p>

<p>The painter rose from the sand and he too wiped his face,
which was<br>
 drawn in agony.</p>

<p>"Herbert, Herbert!" cried Adele Bernauer suddenly. "Oh,
Herbert,<br>
 you will live, you will! Promise me, you will not think of
suicide,<br>
 it would kill your wife - "</p>

<p>She lay on her knees before him in the sand. He looked down at
her<br>
 gently and with a gesture which seemed to be a familiar one of
days<br>
 long past, he stroked the face that had grown old and worn in
these<br>
 hours of fear for him.</p>

<p>"Yes, you dear good soul, I will live on, I will take upon
myself my<br>
 punishment for killing a scoundrel. The poor man whom they
have<br>
 arrested in my place must not linger in the fear of death. I
am<br>
 ready, sir.</p>

<p>"My name is Muller - detective Muller."</p>

<p>"Joseph Muller, the famous detective Muller?" asked Thorne
with a<br>
 sad smile. "I have had little to do with the police but by
chance<br>
 I have heard of your fame. I might have known; they tell me
you<br>
 are one from whom the truth can never remain hidden."</p>

<p>"My duty is not always an easy one," said Muller.</p>

<p>"Thank you. Dispose of me as you will. I do not wish any<br>
 privileges that others would not have, Mr. Muller. Here is
my<br>
 written confession and here am I myself. Shall we go. now?"<br>
 Herbert Thorne handed the detective his notebook with its
important<br>
 contents and then walked slowly back along the road he had
come.</p>

<p>Muller walked a little behind him, while Mrs. Bernauer was at
his<br>
 side. As in days long past, they walked hand in hand.</p>

<p>With eyes full of pity Muller watched them, and he heard
Thorne<br>
 give his old nurse orders for the care of his wife. She was to
take<br>
 Mrs. Thorne to Graz to her father, then to return herself to
Vienna<br>
 and take care of the house as usual, until his attorney could
settle<br>
 up his affairs and sell the property. For Thorne said that
neither<br>
 he nor his wife would ever want to set foot in the house again.
He<br>
 spoke calmly, he thought of everything - he thought even of
the<br>
 possibility that he might have to pay the death penalty for his
deed.</p>

<p>For who could tell how the authorities would judge this
murder?</p>

<p>It had indeed been a murder by merest chance only. Thorne told
his<br>
 old nurse all about it. When she had given him the signal he
had<br>
 hurried down into the garden, and walking quietly along the
path,<br>
 he had found his wife at the garden gate in conversation with a
man<br>
 who was a stranger to him. That part of their talk which he<br>
 overheard told him that the man was a blackmailer, and that he
was<br>
 making money on the fact that he had caught Theobald Leining
cheating<br>
 at cards.</p>

<p>This chance had put the officer into Winkler's power. The
clerk<br>
 knew that he could get nothing from the guilty man himself, so
he<br>
 had turned to the latter's sister, who was rich, and had
threatened<br>
 to bring about a disgraceful scandal if she did not pay for
his<br>
 silence. For more than a year he had been getting money from
her<br>
 by means of these threats. All this was clear from the
conversation.<br>
 The man spoke in tones of impertinence, or sneering
obsequiousness,<br>
 the woman s voice showed contempt and hatred.</p>

<p>Thorne's blood began to boil. His fingers tightened about
the<br>
 revolver which he had brought with him to be ready for any
emergency,<br>
 and he stepped designedly upon a twig which broke under his
feet<br>
 with a noise. He wanted to frighten his wife and send her back
to<br>
 the house. This was what did occur. But the blackmailer was
alarmed<br>
 as well and fled hastily from the garden when he realised that
he was<br>
 not alone with his victim. Thorne followed the man's
disappearing<br>
 figure, calling him to halt. He did not call loudly for he too
wanted<br>
 to avoid a scandal. His intention was to force the man to follow
him<br>
 into the house, to get his written confession of blackmail -
then to<br>
 finish him off with a large sum once for all and kick him out of
the<br>
 place.</p>

<p>In this manner Herbert Thorne thought to free himself and his
wife<br>
 from the persecutions of the rascal. His heart was filled
with<br>
 hatred towards the man. For since Mrs. Bernauer had told him
what<br>
 she had discovered, he knew that it was because of this wretch
that<br>
 his once so happy wife was losing her strength, her health and
her<br>
 peace of mind.</p>

<p>He followed the fleeing man and called to him several times to
halt.<br>
 Finally Winkler half turned and called out over his shoulder:
"You'd<br>
 better leave me alone! Do you want all Vienna to know that
your<br>
 brother-in-law ought to be in jail?"</p>

<p>These words robbed Thorne of all control. He pressed the
trigger<br>
 under his finger and the bullet struck the man before him, who
had<br>
 turned to continue his flight, full in the back. "And that is
how<br>
 I became a murderer." With these words Herbert Thorne concluded
his<br>
 narrative. He appeared quite calm now. He was really calmer,
for<br>
 the strain of the deed, which was justified in his eyes, was not
so<br>
 great upon his conscience as had been the strain of the secret
of it.</p>

<p>In his own eyes he had only killed a beast who chanced to bear
the<br>
 form of a man. But of course in the eyes of the world this was
a<br>
 murder like any other, and the man who had committed it knew
that<br>
 he was under the ban of the law, that it was only a chance that
the<br>
 arm of justice had not yet reached out for him. And now this
arm<br>
 had reached out for him, although it was no longer necessary.
For<br>
 Herbert Thorne was not the man to allow another to suffer in
his<br>
 stead.</p>

<p>As soon as he knew that another had been arrested and was
under<br>
 suspicion of the murder, he knew that there was nothing more
for<br>
 him but open confession. But he wished to avoid a scandal even
now.<br>
 If he died by his own hand, then the first cause of all this
trouble,<br>
 his brother-in-law's rascality, could still be hidden.</p>

<p>But now his care was all in vain and Herbert Thorne knew that
he<br>
 must submit to the inevitable. Side by side with his old
friend<br>
 he sat on the deck of the boat that took them back to the Riva
dei<br>
 Schiavoni. Muller sat at some distance from them. The pale<br>
 sad-faced woman, and the pale sad-faced man had much to say to
each<br>
 other that a stranger might not hear.</p>

<p>When the little boat reached the landing stage, there were but
a<br>
 few steps more to the door of the Hotel Danieli. From a balcony
on<br>
 the first floor a young woman stood looking down onto the
canal.<br>
 She too was pale and her eyes were heavy with anxiety. She had
been<br>
 pale and anxious even then, the day when she left the beautiful
old<br>
 house in the quiet street, to start on this pleasure trip to
Venice.</p>

<p>It had been no pleasure trip to her. She had seen the change
in her<br>
 husband, a change that struck deep into his very being and
altered<br>
 him in everything except in his love and tender care for her.
"Oh,<br>
 why is it? what is the matter?" she asked her self a thousand
times<br>
 a day. Could it be possible that he had discovered the secret
which<br>
 tortured her, the only secret she had ever had from him, the
secret<br>
 she had longed to confess to him a hundred times but had
lacked<br>
 courage to do it.</p>

<p>For she had sinned deeply against her husband, she knew. Her
fear<br>
 and her confusion had driven her deeper and deeper into the
waters<br>
 of deceit until it was impossible for her to find the words
that<br>
 would have brought help and comfort from the man whom she loved
more<br>
 than anything else in the world. In the very earliest stages
of<br>
 Winkler's persecution she had lost her head completely and
instead<br>
 of confessing to her husband and asking for his aid and
protection,<br>
 she had pawned the rich jewels which had been his wedding
present to<br>
 get the money demanded by the blackmailer. In her ignorance she
had<br>
 thought that this one sum would satisfy him.</p>

<p><br>
 But he came again and again, demanding money which she saved
from<br>
 her pin money, from her household allowance, thus taking what
she<br>
 had intended to use to redeem her jewels. The pledge was lost,
and<br>
 her jewels gone forever. From now on, Mrs. Thorne lived in a
terror<br>
 which sapped her strength and drank her life blood drop by drop.
Any<br>
 hour might bring discovery, a discovery which she feared would
shake<br>
 her husband's love for her. The poor weak little woman grew pale
and<br>
 ill. She wrote finally to her step-brother, but he could think
of no<br>
 way out; he wrote only that if the matter came to a scandal
there<br>
 would be nothing for him to do but to kill himself. This was
one<br>
 reason more for her silence, and Mrs. Thome faded to a wan
shadow of<br>
 her former sunny self.</p>

<p>As she looked down from the balcony, she was like a woman
suffering<br>
 from a deathly illness. A new terror had come to her heart
because<br>
 her husband had gone away so early without telling her why or
whither<br>
 he had gone. When she saw him coming towards the door of the
hotel,<br>
 pale and drooping, and when she saw Mrs. Bernauer beside him,
her<br>
 heart seemed to stand still. She crept back from the window
and<br>
 stood in the middle of the room as Herbert Thorne and his
former<br>
 nurse entered.</p>

<p>"What has happened?" This was all she could say as she looked
into<br>
 the distraught face of the housekeeper, into her husband's sad
eyes.</p>

<p>He led her to a chair, then knelt beside her and told her
all.</p>

<p>"Outside the door stands the man who will take me back to
Vienna<br>
 - and you, my dearest, you must go to your father." He concluded
his<br>
 story with these words.</p>

<p>She bent down over him and kissed him. "'No, I am going with
you,"<br>
 she said softly, strangely calm; "why should I leave you now?
Is<br>
 it not I who am the cause of this dreadful thing?"</p>

<p>And then she made her confession, much too late. And she went
with<br>
 him, back to the city of their home. It seemed to them both
quite<br>
 natural that she should do so.</p>

<p>When the Northern Express rolled out of Venice that afternoon,
three<br>
 people sat together in a compartment, the curtains of which
were<br>
 drawn close. They were the unhappy couple and their faithful<br>
 servant. And outside in the corridor of the railway carriage,
a<br>
 small, slight man walked up and down - up and down. He had
pressed<br>
 a gold coin into the conductor's hand, with the words: "The
party<br>
 in there do not wish to be disturbed; the lady is ill."</p>

<p>Herbert Thorne's trial took place several weeks later.
Every<br>
 possible extenuating circumstance was brought to bear upon
his<br>
 sentence. Five years only was to be the term of his
imprisonment,<br>
 his punishment for the crime of a single moment of anger.</p>

<p>His wife waited for him in patient love. She did not go to
Graz,<br>
 but continued to live in the old mansion with the mansard
roof.<br>
 Her father was with her. The brother Theobald, the cause of
all<br>
 this suffering to those who had shielded him at the expense
of<br>
 their own happiness, had at last done the only good deed of
his<br>
 life - had put an end to his useless existence with his own
hand.</p>

<p>Father and daughter waited patiently for the return of the
man<br>
 who had sinned and suffered for their sake. They spoke of
him<br>
 only in terms of the tenderest affection and respect.</p>

<p>And indeed, seldom has any condemned murderer met with the
respect<br>
 of the entire community as Herbert Thorne did. The tone of
the<br>
 newspapers, and public opinion, evinced by hundreds of letters
from<br>
 friends, acquaintances, and from strangers, was a great boon
to<br>
 the solitary man in his cell, and to the three loving hearts in
the<br>
 old house. And at the end of two years the clemency of the
Monarch<br>
 ended his term of imprisonment, and Herbert Thorne was set free,
a<br>
 step which met with the approval of the entire city.</p>

<p>He returned to the home where love and affection awaited him,
ready<br>
 to make him forget what he had suffered. But the silver threads
in<br>
 his dark hair and a certain quiet seriousness in his manner, and
in<br>
 the hearts of all the dwellers in the old mansion, showed that
the<br>
 occurrence of that fatal 27th of September had thrown a shadow
over<br>
 them all which was not to be shaken off.</p>

<p>Joseph Muller brought many other cases to a successful
solution.<br>
 But for years after this particular case had been won, he
was<br>
 followed, as by a shadow, by a man who watched over him, and
who,<br>
 whenever danger threatened, stood over the frail detective as
if<br>
 to take the blow upon himself. He is a clever assistant, too,
and<br>
 no one who had seen Johann Knoll the day that he was put into
the<br>
 cell on suspicion of murder would have believed that the idle
tramp<br>
 could become again such a useful member of society. These are
the<br>
 victories that Joseph Muller considers his greatest.</p>

End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Grace Isabel Colbron and Augusta Groner
by The Lamp That Went Out

*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK COLBURN AND GRONER ***

This file should be named tltwo10h.htm or tltwo10h.zip
Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks get a new NUMBER, tltwo11h.txt
VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, tltwo10ha.txt

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext03 or
ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03

Or /etext02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain

things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
